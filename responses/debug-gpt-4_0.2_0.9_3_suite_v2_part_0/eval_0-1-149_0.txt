Sure, you can achieve this by using Tailwind CSS's group-hover variant. You can control the width of the span on hover by using the `group-hover:w-full` class. Here is the revised code:

```html
<a href="#" class="group inline-block text-sky-600 transition duration-300">
    Link
    <span class="block w-0 group-hover:w-full transition-all duration-500 h-0.5 bg-sky-600"></span>
</a>
```

In the above code, the `group-hover:w-full` class will make the span's width full when you hover over the link. The `transition-all` class is used to apply the transition effect to all properties. The `duration-500` class is used to control the duration of the transition.

Please note that by default, the `group-hover` variant is not enabled for all utilities in Tailwind CSS. If the `group-hover` variant is not working for you, you might need to enable it in your Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  variants: {
    extend: {
      width: ['group-hover'],
    }
  }
}
```

This will enable the `group-hover` variant for the width utility. After making changes to your Tailwind CSS configuration file, you might need to rebuild your CSS.
