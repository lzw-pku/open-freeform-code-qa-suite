Sure, you can revise the code as follows:

```jsx
<Form.Item name="switch" valuePropName="checked">
    <Switch checkedChildren="Yes" unCheckedChildren="No" />
</Form.Item>
    <span>Chargable</span>
```

In your original code, you used `noStyle` which might cause the issue. The `noStyle` prop is used to remove the style of the Form.Item, but it also removes the functionality of the Form.Item. So, you should remove `noStyle` from the Form.Item props. 

Also, ensure that the `onCreate` function is correctly handling the `switch` value.
