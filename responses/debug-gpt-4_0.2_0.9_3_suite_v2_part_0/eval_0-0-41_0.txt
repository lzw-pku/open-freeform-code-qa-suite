The `navigator.geolocation` object is available in the user's browser, but it doesn't mean the user has granted permission to access their location. The `getCurrentPosition` method is asynchronous and takes two callbacks: one for success and one for error. 

Here is how you can modify your code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            if (error.code == error.PERMISSION_DENIED)
                console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, if the user has denied permission, the error callback will be invoked and "User not allowed" will be logged to the console. If the geolocation object is not available at all (which could happen in older browsers), "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged.
