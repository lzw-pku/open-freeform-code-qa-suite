Sure, the issue is that you're returning an object instead of a function that returns an object. When you use `new API()`, JavaScript expects `API` to be a constructor function, not an object. Here's how you can fix it:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this revised version, `jest.mock` is returning a mock function that, when invoked with `new`, returns an object with the `someMethod` function. This way, `new API()` will work as expected.
