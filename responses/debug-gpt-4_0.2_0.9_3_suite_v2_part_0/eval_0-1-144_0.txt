You can change the accordion arrow color by targeting the `.accordion-button::after` pseudo-element in your CSS. This pseudo-element is used by Bootstrap to create the arrow. Here's an example of how you can change its color to green:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is expanded */
    color: green;
}

.accordion-button::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is collapsed */
    color: green;
}
```

This CSS will change the color of the arrow to green both when the accordion is collapsed and when it is expanded. If you want different colors for these two states, you can use different color values in the two rules.

Remember to include this CSS after the Bootstrap CSS in your HTML file, or else the Bootstrap styles may override your custom styles.
