The issue you're experiencing is likely due to Vite's server configuration. By default, Vite's development server only accepts connections from localhost for security reasons. To accept connections from other hosts, you need to set the `host` option in the server configuration to `0.0.0.0`.

Update your `vite.config.ts` file as follows:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This change will allow connections from any host, which should allow your Docker container to connect to the Vite server. After making this change, try running your Docker container again and see if you can access the Vite server from your browser.
