ESLint is complaining because it's a best practice to name your components in React. This helps in debugging and also improves readability of the code.

In your case, you are using an anonymous function as a component. To fix the ESLint error, you can assign a name to the function. Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: function RenderCountForCountry(text) {
        return <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>
      },
    }
  ]
```

In the above code, I have named the function `RenderCountForCountry`. This should fix the ESLint error.
