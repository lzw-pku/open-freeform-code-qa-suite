The issue you're experiencing is a known bug in Safari's implementation of flexbox. When an image is a child of a flex container, Safari does not correctly maintain the aspect ratio of the image when height is set to auto.

To fix this, you can add `align-self: flex-start;` to the image. This will align the image at the start of the cross axis, and it will no longer stretch to fill its container.

Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
  align-self: flex-start; /* Add this line */
}
```

This should fix the issue in Safari while not affecting the layout in other browsers.
