Yes, you can modify the internal CSS of Firefox to reduce the spacing between menu items. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open Firefox and type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter. Click on "Accept the Risk and Continue" if a warning page appears.

2. In the search bar on the new page, type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set its value to `true` by clicking on the toggle button.

3. Now, navigate to your Firefox profile folder. You can find it by typing `about:support` in the address bar and pressing Enter. In the "Profile Folder" row, click on "Open Folder".

4. In the profile folder, create a new folder and name it `chrome` if it doesn't exist.

5. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css`. If the file already exists, open it.

6. Paste the following CSS code into the `userChrome.css` file:

```css
/* Reduce Spacing in Menus for Proton UI in Firefox */
:root {
  --proton-menupopup-item-height: 25px !important;
}
```

7. Save the `userChrome.css` file and restart Firefox.

This CSS code changes the height of the menu items to 25 pixels. You can adjust the pixel value to increase or decrease the spacing as per your preference.
