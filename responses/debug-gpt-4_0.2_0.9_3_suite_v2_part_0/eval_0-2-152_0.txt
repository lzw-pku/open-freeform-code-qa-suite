To show the toast, you need to call the `toast` method with the `show` argument on the toast element. Here's how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast on a specific event, like a button click, you can put this code inside an event handler. 

Also, ensure that you have included the necessary Bootstrap CSS and JS files in your HTML file. The toast component requires Bootstrap's JavaScript and jQuery. 

Here's an example:

```html
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- JS, Popper.js, and jQuery -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Remember to place the JavaScript files at the end of your body tag to ensure that your DOM is fully loaded before the scripts run.
