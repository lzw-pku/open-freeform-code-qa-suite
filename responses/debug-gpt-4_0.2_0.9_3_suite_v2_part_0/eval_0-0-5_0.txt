The error log indicates that Python is not found in your system. Node-gyp, which is a part of your project dependencies, requires Python to be installed in your system.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. Install Python 2.7.x (node-gyp does not work with Python 3.x). You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. After installing Python, you need to add it to your system PATH. Here is how you can do it:

   - Open the System Properties (Right click Computer in the start menu, or use the keyboard shortcut Win+Pause)
   - Click Advanced system settings in the sidebar.
   - Click Environment Variables...
   - Select PATH in the System variables section
   - Click Edit
   - Add Python's path to the end of the list (the paths are separated by semicolons). For example:
     ```
     C:\Program Files;C:\Winnt;C:\Winnt\System32;C:\Python27
     ```

3. After Python is installed and set up, you can verify the installation by opening a new command prompt and typing `python --version`. It should display the Python version that you installed.

4. Now, you should be able to build your project without the Python error.

If you still encounter issues, you might need to install the Windows build tools which include other dependencies required by node-gyp. You can do this by running the following command in the command prompt with administrative privileges:

```shell
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

This will install Python 2.7 and Visual Studio Build Tools, which are required by node-gyp.
