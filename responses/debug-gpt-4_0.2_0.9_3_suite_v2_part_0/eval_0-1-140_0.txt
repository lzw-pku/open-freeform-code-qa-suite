Font Awesome 5 has a few changes compared to Font Awesome 4. The `font-family` is no longer just "FontAwesome", it's now separated into three different font families: "Font Awesome 5 Free", "Font Awesome 5 Brands", and "Font Awesome 5 Pro". The `content` value also may have changed for some icons.

For the regular free icons, you would use "Font Awesome 5 Free" and also need to set `font-weight` to 900. 

Here is how you can adjust your CSS for Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

Please note that the `content` value (`"\f107"`) is for the "angle-down" icon in both Font Awesome 4 and 5. If you want to use a different icon, you'll need to look up the correct `content` value in the Font Awesome 5 documentation.
