The error message `Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted` is indicating that the username and password you're using to authenticate with Gmail's SMTP server are not being accepted.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your username and password**: Make sure that the username and password you're using are correct. The username should be your full email address, and the password should be your Gmail password.

2. **Enable Less Secure Apps**: Google may block sign-in attempts from some apps or devices that do not use modern security standards. You can change your settings to allow less secure apps into your account. However, this is not recommended because it can make it easier for others to break into your account. You can enable it by going to your Google Account > Security > Less secure app access > Turn on access.

3. **Use App Password**: If you have 2-Step Verification enabled for your Google account, you may need to generate and use an app password for your account. An app password is a 16-digit passcode that gives less secure apps or devices permission to access your Google Account. You can generate it by going to your Google Account > Security > App passwords.

4. **Unlock Captcha**: Sometimes, Google may block a sign-in attempt if it's not sure it's you. Therefore, you may need to allow access to your Google account by unlocking Captcha. You can do it by visiting this URL: https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha

After trying these steps, your code should work as expected. If you're still having trouble, you may want to consider using a different method to send email from your Node.js app, such as using a service like SendGrid or Mailgun.
