Angular CLI does not provide a specific command to remove a package. However, you can remove a package manually by following these steps:

1. Open the `package.json` file in your Angular project.

2. Find the package you want to remove in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` section.

3. Remove the line that includes the package name.

4. Save the `package.json` file.

5. Run the following command in your terminal to update the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file:

```bash
npm install
```

This will remove the package from your project. If you want to remove the package files from the `node_modules` folder without updating the `package-lock.json` file, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm prune
```

This command removes "extraneous" packages. Extraneous packages are packages that are not listed on the parent package's dependencies list.
