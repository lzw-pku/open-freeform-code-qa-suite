The error message is indicating that Vue.js is expecting a primitive value (string or number) as the key in your `v-for` loop, but it's getting a non-primitive value (probably an object) instead.

In your case, `comment` is likely an object, and you're using it as the key. Vue uses the key to track each node's identity, so it can reuse and reorder existing elements. You should use a unique primitive value from each `comment` object as the key.

If each `comment` has a unique id, you can use that as the key:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

If there's no unique id, but you're sure that the `comment.text` is unique, you can use that:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.text">
```

If neither of these are unique, you can use the index of the loop:

```html
<div v-for="(comment, index) in comments" :key="index">
```

Remember, it's important that the key is unique to each item in the array. If two items have the same key, Vue won't be able to track them separately and it could lead to rendering issues.
