Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. It doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements like you would do in CSS with the `>` operator. 

Tailwind focuses on providing utility classes to style individual elements. If you want to style direct children of a `div` with a class of `.section`, you would need to apply the styles directly to those child `div` elements in your HTML using the appropriate Tailwind classes.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white">...</div> <!-- Apply Tailwind classes directly -->
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white">...</div> <!-- Apply Tailwind classes directly -->
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-blue-500` and `text-white` are Tailwind classes applied directly to the child `div` elements.

If you need more advanced selectors, you might need to write custom CSS or consider using a preprocessor like Sass or Less in combination with Tailwind.
