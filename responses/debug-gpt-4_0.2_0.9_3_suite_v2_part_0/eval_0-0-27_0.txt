The code you provided seems to be correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you can check if the loading state is hanging:

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure that your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. Sometimes, network issues can cause the query to hang indefinitely.

2. **Server Status**: Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can test this by opening the URL in a web browser and see if it returns a response.

3. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you are using. Try downgrading or upgrading the version to see if it solves the issue.

4. **Error Handling**: Apollo Client's `useQuery` hook may not throw an error even if the query fails. Instead, it sets the `error` property of the result object. Try logging the `error` property to see if there are any issues with the query.

5. **React Native Debugger**: If you are using React Native Debugger, there could be an issue with it that's causing the network requests to hang. Try disabling it and see if the issue persists.

6. **Apollo Client Cache**: There might be an issue with Apollo Client's cache. Try disabling the cache to see if it solves the issue. You can do this by adding `fetchPolicy: 'no-cache'` to the options of the `useQuery` hook.

If none of the above solutions work, it would be helpful to see the server logs or any error messages you are receiving.
