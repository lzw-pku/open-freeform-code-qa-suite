Sure, you can't directly combine two mapped types into one in TypeScript. However, you can use intersection (`&`) to achieve this. Here is the correct definition:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This will create a type `FruitsAndColors` where each fruit key is a number and each color key is a boolean.
