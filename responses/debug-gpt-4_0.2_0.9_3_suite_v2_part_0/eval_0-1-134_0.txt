It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a web-developerâ€™s toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow. It's available as a plugin for many popular text editors like VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, and others.

For example, in HTML, if you type `.classname` and press `Tab`, it will automatically expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`.

To make this work, you need to ensure a few things:

1. You're using a text editor that supports Emmet (like VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.).
2. Emmet is installed and enabled in your text editor.
3. You're in a file type that Emmet recognizes (like .html for HTML, .css for CSS, etc.).

If you're using VS Code, Emmet is built in and enabled by default for HTML, HAML, Pug, SLIM, JSX, XML, XSL, CSS, SCSS, SASS, LESS and STYLUS files.

If you're using another editor, you may need to install Emmet as a plugin. You can check the [Emmet Documentation](https://docs.emmet.io/) for more details on how to install and use it.
