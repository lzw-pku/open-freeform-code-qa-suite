It seems like IntelliJ IDEA is still using the old version of Java (1.8) to compile your application. You need to configure IntelliJ IDEA to use Java 11 instead.

1. Go to `File > Project Structure > Project` and make sure that the `Project SDK` is set to Java 11.
2. Go to `File > Project Structure > Modules` and make sure that the `Language level` is set to `11 - Local variable syntax for lambda parameters`.
3. Go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle` and make sure that the `Gradle JVM` is set to Java 11.
4. If you are using Maven, go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven` and make sure that the `Maven home directory` is set to the correct path for Java 11.

After making these changes, try rebuilding your application and see if it compiles successfully with Java 11.
