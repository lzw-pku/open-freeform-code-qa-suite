In Java 8, you can use the `getClass()` method to get the class of an object and the `getSimpleName()` method to get the name of the class as a string. Here's an example:

```java
Object obj = "Hello";
System.out.println(obj.getClass().getSimpleName()); // String

obj = 123;
System.out.println(obj.getClass().getSimpleName()); // Integer

obj = 12.3f;
System.out.println(obj.getClass().getSimpleName()); // Float
```

This approach works for both primitive and reference types. However, keep in mind that it only works for objects, not for variables that are not initialized or null.
