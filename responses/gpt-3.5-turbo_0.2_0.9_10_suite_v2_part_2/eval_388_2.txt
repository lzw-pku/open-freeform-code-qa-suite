The error message indicates that the table "Keys" does not exist in the database. This could be caused by a migration issue during the upgrade process.

To solve this problem, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the "Keys" table exists in the database. You can use a SQLite client tool or run a SQL query to check it.

2. If the table does not exist, you need to create it by running the migration command. In the Package Manager Console, run the following command:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

   This will apply any pending migrations to the database and create the "Keys" table.

3. If the table already exists, you can try to drop and recreate it by running the following commands:

   ```
   Drop-Table Keys
   Update-Database
   ```

   This will drop the "Keys" table and create it again with the latest schema.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try to revert the upgrade and check if the problem still exists. If it does not, you can try to upgrade again and make sure that all the migrations are applied correctly.

I hope this helps!
