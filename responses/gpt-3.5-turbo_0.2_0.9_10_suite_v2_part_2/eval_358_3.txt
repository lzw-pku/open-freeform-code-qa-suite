Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It clearly indicates that the class has a dependency on another class and that dependency is injected through the constructor. It also ensures that the dependency is mandatory and must be provided at the time of object creation. Additionally, it makes the class immutable, which is a good practice in general. However, if you prefer to use the setter injection, you can still do it without the `@Autowired` annotation.
