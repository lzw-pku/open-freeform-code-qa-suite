It seems like the Gradle build is not picking up the Java version you have set in your project. You can try adding the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```
tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
    options.compilerArgs << '--release' << '17'
}
```

This will explicitly set the Java release version to 17 for the Java compiler.
