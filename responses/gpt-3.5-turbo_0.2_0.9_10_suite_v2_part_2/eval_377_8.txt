It seems like IntelliJ IDEA is still using the old JDK version (1.8) to compile your code. You need to configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the new JDK version (11.0.1) instead. 

To do this, go to `File > Project Structure > Project Settings > Project` and select the new JDK version (11.0.1) from the dropdown list under `Project SDK`. 

Then, go to `File > Project Structure > Project Settings > Modules` and select each module that you want to compile with the new JDK version. Under the `Dependencies` tab, make sure that the new JDK version is selected as the `Module SDK`. 

After making these changes, try rebuilding your application and see if it compiles successfully with the new JDK version.
