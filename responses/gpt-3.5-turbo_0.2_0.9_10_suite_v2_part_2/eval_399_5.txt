You need to register the `ILogger` service in the `ServiceCollection`. You can do this by adding the following line to your `ServiceCollection` configuration:
```c#
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddLogging(logging => logging.AddConsole())
    .AddTransient<MyClass>() // Add this line
    .BuildServiceProvider();
```
This will register `MyClass` with the `ServiceCollection` and allow it to resolve the `ILogger` dependency.
