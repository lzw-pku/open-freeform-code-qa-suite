It's possible that the XML response is not properly configured in your Spring Boot project. You can check if the Jackson XML dependency is included in your project and if the `produces` attribute is set to include XML in your `@RestController` annotation. For example:
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping(value = "/pet", produces = { "application/json", "application/xml" })
public class PetApiController implements PetApi {
    // ...
}
``` 
Also, make sure that the `accept` header in your curl command is set to `application/xml`.
