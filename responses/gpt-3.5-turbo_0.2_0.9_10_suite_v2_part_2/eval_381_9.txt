To use Swagger UI with Spring Boot, you need to make sure that you have the following configurations in your application:

1. Add the `@EnableSwagger2` annotation to your Spring Boot application class.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSwagger2
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

2. Configure Swagger to scan your API packages by adding the `@ComponentScan` annotation to your Spring Boot application class.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSwagger2
@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.example.api"})
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

3. Configure Swagger to use the correct base path for your API by adding the following properties to your `application.properties` file.

```properties
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/swagger-ui.html
springdoc.api-docs.path=/v3/api-docs
```

4. Make sure that your API documentation is available at the correct URL. You can check this by visiting `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs` in your browser. If you can see the JSON output of your API documentation, then Swagger UI should be able to find it.

If you have followed these steps and are still experiencing issues, try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser.
