It seems like IntelliJ is still using the old version of Java (1.8) to compile your code. You need to configure IntelliJ to use the new JDK 11. 

To do this, go to `File > Project Structure > Project` and select the correct JDK version (11.0.1) from the dropdown list under `Project SDK`. 

If you don't see the JDK 11.0.1 in the dropdown list, you need to add it first by clicking on the `New` button and selecting the path to the JDK 11.0.1 installation directory (`C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1` in your case).

After selecting the correct JDK version, rebuild your project and it should compile without errors.
