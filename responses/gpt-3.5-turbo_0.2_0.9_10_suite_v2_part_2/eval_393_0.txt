Having separate pipelines for specific requests is not necessarily a bad practice. In fact, it can be a good practice as it allows you to have more control over the behavior of each pipeline and keep the logic separate and organized.

However, having too many pipelines can also lead to complexity and maintenance issues. It's important to strike a balance between having enough pipelines to handle specific requests and keeping the overall design simple and manageable.

If you find that you have many pipelines that are very similar, you may want to consider refactoring your code to use a more generic pipeline that can handle multiple types of requests. This can help simplify your code and make it easier to maintain in the long run.

Ultimately, the decision to use separate pipelines or a more generic pipeline will depend on the specific requirements of your project and the trade-offs you are willing to make in terms of complexity and maintainability.
