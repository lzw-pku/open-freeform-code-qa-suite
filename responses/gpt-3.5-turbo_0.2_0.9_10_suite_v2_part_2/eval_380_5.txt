In Java 8, you can use the `getClass()` method to get the class of an object. This method returns an instance of the `Class` class, which provides various methods to get information about the class, including its name.

Here's an example:

```java
Object obj = "Hello";
Class<?> cls = obj.getClass();
System.out.println(cls.getName()); // prints "java.lang.String"

obj = 123;
cls = obj.getClass();
System.out.println(cls.getName()); // prints "java.lang.Integer"

obj = 12.3f;
cls = obj.getClass();
System.out.println(cls.getName()); // prints "java.lang.Float"
```

Note that this approach works for both objects and primitive types. However, it may not be as convenient as the `typeof` operator in JavaScript, as you need to create an object to get its class.
