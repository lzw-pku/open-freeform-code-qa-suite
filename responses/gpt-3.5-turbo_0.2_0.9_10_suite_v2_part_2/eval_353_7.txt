The error message suggests that the `--add-opens` option is not recognized by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that is being used to run Besu. This option is used to specify additional packages that should be opened for reflection, and it was introduced in Java 9.

Based on the output of `java -version`, it seems that you are using Java 8, which does not support this option. Besu requires Java 11 or later, so you will need to install a newer version of Java in order to run it.

You can download the latest version of Java from the official website: https://www.java.com/en/download/. Once you have installed Java 11 or later, you should be able to run Besu without encountering this error.
