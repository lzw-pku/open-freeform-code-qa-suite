It seems that there might be a conflict between the version of Hibernate Validator that is included in your project and the version that is being used by JBoss. 

You can try to exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from your project and let JBoss use its own version. To do this, add the following exclusion to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

Then, make sure that JBoss is using a version of Hibernate Validator that is compatible with your project. You can check the JBoss documentation or try to add the following dependency to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.5.Final-redhat-2</version>
</dependency>
```

If this doesn't work, you can try to upgrade your project to use Hibernate Validator 6.x, which is the latest version. To do this, add the following dependency to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

Then, make sure that your project is using the correct version of Hibernate Validator by checking the logs when starting up your application.
