The error message suggests that the `--add-opens` option is not recognized by the version of Java you have installed. This option was added in Java 9, so it's possible that you have an older version of Java installed on your system.

You can check which version of Java is being used by running the following command:

```shell
java -version
```

If you have an older version of Java installed, you can try installing a newer version and setting your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the new installation. You can then try running the `besu` command again.

If you already have Java 9 or later installed, it's possible that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is not set correctly. You can try setting it manually to the path of your Java installation directory. For example, on Windows, you might set it to:

```shell
set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.2
```

Make sure to replace the path with the actual path to your Java installation directory.

If neither of these solutions work, you can try posting a question on the Hyperledger Besu forum or opening an issue on their GitHub repository.
