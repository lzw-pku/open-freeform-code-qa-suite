Having separate pipelines for specific requests is not necessarily a bad practice. In fact, it can be a good practice to keep the logic for each request separate and organized. 

However, it's important to consider the overall design and architecture of your application. If you find yourself creating many separate pipelines for different requests, it may be a sign that your application is becoming too complex and difficult to maintain. In this case, you may want to consider refactoring your code to simplify it.

Another option to consider is using a more flexible approach to handling requests, such as using a mediator pattern. This can allow you to handle multiple types of requests with a single pipeline, while still keeping the logic for each request separate. 

Ultimately, the best approach will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.
