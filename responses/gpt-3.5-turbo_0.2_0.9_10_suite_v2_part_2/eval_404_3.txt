You can use the `JsonResult` class to return JSON with a specific HTTP status code in your .NET Core Web API controller. Here's an example:

```c#
public IActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    var data = "123";
    return new JsonResult(data)
    {
        StatusCode = 200 // or any other HTTP status code
    };
}
```

In this example, we create a new instance of the `JsonResult` class and pass in the data that we want to serialize as JSON. We then set the `StatusCode` property to the desired HTTP status code. Finally, we return the `JsonResult` instance from the action method.

Note that we are using `IActionResult` as the return type instead of `ActionResult`. This allows us to return any type of result from the action method, including `JsonResult`.
