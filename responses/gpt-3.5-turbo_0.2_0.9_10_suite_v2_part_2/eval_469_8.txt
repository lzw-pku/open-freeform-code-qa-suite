Here's the implementation of the `getASCIIAsString` function in Go:

```go
func getASCIIAsString(asciiCode uint64) string {
    return string(asciiCode)
}
```

This function takes an `uint64` ASCII code as input and returns the corresponding ASCII string. The `string` function in Go converts a sequence of bytes (in this case, a single byte represented by the `uint64` value) into a string.
