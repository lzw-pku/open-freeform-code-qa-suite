It seems that there might be a version conflict between the Hibernate Validator version that is included in your Spring Boot parent pom.xml and the version that is resolved by Maven. 

You can try to exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from your Spring Boot parent pom.xml and add the desired version as a separate dependency in your pom.xml. 

To do this, add the following exclusion to your parent pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

Then, add the desired version of Hibernate Validator as a separate dependency in your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

This should resolve any version conflicts and allow you to use the @NotEmpty and @NotBlank annotations as expected.
