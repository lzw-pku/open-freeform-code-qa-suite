In a .NET 6 Console Application, you can use the `Host` class to build and run your application. Here's an example of how to read the `appsettings.json` file:

```c#
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

var builder = new HostBuilder()
    .ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>
    {
        config.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true);
    })
    .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =>
    {
        // Add your services here
    });

await builder.RunConsoleAsync();
```

In this example, we're using the `HostBuilder` to build our application. We're also using the `ConfigureAppConfiguration` method to add the `appsettings.json` file to the configuration. Finally, we're using the `ConfigureServices` method to add our services.

Note that you'll need to add the following NuGet packages to your project:

- Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
- Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json
- Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting
- Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions

I hope this helps!
