The error message indicates that the table "Keys" does not exist in the database. This could be caused by a migration issue during the upgrade process.

To solve this problem, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that you have applied all the necessary migrations to the database. You can use the following command in the Package Manager Console to apply the migrations:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

2. If the migration step does not solve the problem, you can try deleting the database and creating a new one. You can use the following commands in the Package Manager Console to delete and create the database:

   ```
   Drop-Database
   Update-Database
   ```

   Note that this will delete all the data in the database, so make sure to backup any important data before proceeding.

3. If the problem persists, you can try checking the connection string in your project to make sure that it is pointing to the correct database.

   ```
   "ConnectionStrings": {
     "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=mydatabase.db"
   }
   ```

   Make sure that the database file exists in the specified location.

Hopefully, one of these steps will solve the problem.
