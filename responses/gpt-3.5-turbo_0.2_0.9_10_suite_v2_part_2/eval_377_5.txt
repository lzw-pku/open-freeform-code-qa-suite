It seems like IntelliJ IDEA is still using the old version of Java (1.8) to compile your code. You need to configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the new JDK 11. 

To do this, go to `File > Project Structure > SDKs` and click on the `+` button to add a new JDK. Select the path to your JDK 11 installation (`C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1`) and click OK. 

Then, go to `File > Project Structure > Project` and select the newly added JDK 11 as the Project SDK. 

Finally, go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler` and make sure that the `Target bytecode version` is set to 11. 

After making these changes, try building your application again and see if it works.
