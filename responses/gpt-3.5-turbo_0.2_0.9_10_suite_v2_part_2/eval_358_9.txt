Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and easier to test. By using constructor injection, you ensure that all required dependencies are provided at the time of object creation, making the object more predictable and easier to reason about. Additionally, using `@Autowired` on the constructor allows you to make the injected dependencies `final`, which can help prevent accidental reassignment and improve thread safety. However, it is not mandatory to use `@Autowired` on the constructor, and you can still use setter injection or field injection if you prefer.
