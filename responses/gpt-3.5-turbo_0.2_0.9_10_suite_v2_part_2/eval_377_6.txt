It seems like IntelliJ IDEA is still using the old version of Java (1.8) to compile your code. You need to configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the new JDK 11. 

To do this, go to `File > Project Structure > SDKs`, click on the `+` button and select `JDK`. Then, navigate to the directory where you installed JDK 11 (`C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1`) and select it. 

After that, go to `File > Project Structure > Project` and select the newly added JDK 11 as the Project SDK. 

Finally, go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler` and make sure that the `Target bytecode version` is set to `11`.

Once you have done all these steps, try building your application again and it should use JDK 11 to compile your code.
