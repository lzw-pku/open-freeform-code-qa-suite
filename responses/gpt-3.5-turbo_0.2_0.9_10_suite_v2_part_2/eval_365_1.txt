If you want to use the same version of Java that is used by the Maven task, you can specify the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the location of the JDK used by the Maven task. 

To find the location of the JDK used by the Maven task, you can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
mvn -version
```

This will display the version of Maven and the location of the JDK used by Maven. You can then set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to this location.

For example, if the output of the `mvn -version` command is:

```
Apache Maven 3.6.3
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.6.3/libexec
Java version: 1.8.0_242, vendor: AdoptOpenJDK, runtime: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-8.jdk/Contents/Home
```

You can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-8.jdk/Contents/Home`.

On Unix-based systems, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable by running the following command:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-8.jdk/Contents/Home
```

On Windows, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable by following these steps:

1. Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables".
2. Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
3. Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
4. Under "System Variables", click on "New".
5. Enter "JAVA_HOME" as the variable name and the path to the JDK as the variable value.
6. Click "OK" to save the environment variable.

Once you have set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, you can run the Maven wrapper using the following command:

```
./mvnw <Maven command>
```

Replace `<Maven command>` with the Maven command you want to run, such as `clean install`.
