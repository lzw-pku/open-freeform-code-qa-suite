To use Swagger UI with Spring Boot, you need to configure it properly. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Make sure that you have added the `springdoc-openapi-ui` dependency in your `pom.xml` file.

2. Add the `@EnableSwagger2WebMvc` annotation to your Spring Boot application class.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSwagger2WebMvc
public class YourApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(YourApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

3. Create a new configuration class and add the `@Configuration` and `@EnableSwagger2` annotations.

```java
@Configuration
@EnableSwagger2
public class SwaggerConfig {
    @Bean
    public Docket api() {
        return new Docket(DocumentationType.SWAGGER_2)
                .select()
                .apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.any())
                .paths(PathSelectors.any())
                .build();
    }
}
```

4. Run your Spring Boot application and go to `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` to see the Swagger UI.

If you still get a 404 error, make sure that you have the correct URL and that your application is running on the correct port.
