To use Swagger UI with Spring Boot, you need to make sure that you have the following:

1. The `@EnableSwagger2` annotation on your Spring Boot application class. This enables Swagger support in your application.

2. The `@Configuration` annotation on your Swagger configuration class. This tells Spring that this class contains configuration information.

Here's an example of how to set up Swagger UI with Spring Boot:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableSwagger2
public class SwaggerConfig {
    @Bean
    public Docket api() {
        return new Docket(DocumentationType.SWAGGER_2)
                .select()
                .apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.any())
                .paths(PathSelectors.any())
                .build();
    }
}
```

Make sure that you have the correct version of the `springdoc-openapi-ui` dependency in your `pom.xml` file. You can check the latest version on the [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springdoc/springdoc-openapi-ui).

If you have followed these steps and are still getting a 404 error, try accessing `localhost:8080/v3/api-docs` to see if the OpenAPI specification is being generated correctly. If it is, then the issue may be with the Swagger UI configuration.
