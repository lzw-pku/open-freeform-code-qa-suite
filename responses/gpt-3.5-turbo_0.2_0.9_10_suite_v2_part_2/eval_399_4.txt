You need to register the ILogger service in the service collection. You can do this by adding the following line to your service registration code:
```c#
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddLogging(logging => logging.AddConsole())
    .AddTransient<MyClass>() // Add this line to register MyClass
    .BuildServiceProvider();
```
This will register `MyClass` with the service collection and allow it to receive an instance of `ILogger` through dependency injection.
