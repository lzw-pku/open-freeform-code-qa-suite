It's possible that the XML format is not properly configured in your Spring Boot project. You can check if the Jackson XML library is included in your dependencies and if it's properly configured in your application properties or configuration class. You can also try adding the `produces = {"application/xml", "application/json"}` parameter to your `@GetMapping` annotation to explicitly specify the supported response formats.
