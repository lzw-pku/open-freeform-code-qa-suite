You need to register the `ILogger` service in the `ServiceCollection` before building the `ServiceProvider`. You can do this by adding the `Logging` service to the `ServiceCollection` like so:
```c#
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddLogging(logging => logging.AddConsole())
    .AddTransient<MyClass>() // Add your class to the service collection
    .BuildServiceProvider();
```
This will register the `ILogger` service and allow it to be injected into your `MyClass` constructor.
