Using the `@Autowired` annotation on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring. It helps to clearly indicate the dependencies required by the class and ensures that they are properly injected. It also makes the class more testable as you can easily inject mock dependencies during testing. However, if you prefer not to use `@Autowired`, you can still use constructor injection without it.
