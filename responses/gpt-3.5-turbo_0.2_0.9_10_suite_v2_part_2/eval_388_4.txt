The error message indicates that the `Keys` table is missing in your database. This could be caused by a migration issue during the upgrade process.

To solve this problem, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio by going to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console.

2. Run the following command to generate a new migration:

   ```
   Add-Migration AddKeysTable
   ```

3. Run the following command to apply the migration to the database:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

   This will create the `Keys` table in your database.

If the above steps do not solve the problem, you can try deleting the existing migrations and generating a new one:

1. Delete all existing migrations in the Migrations folder.

2. Run the following command to generate a new migration:

   ```
   Add-Migration InitialCreate
   ```

3. Run the following command to apply the migration to the database:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

   This will create all the necessary tables in your database.

If the problem still persists, you may need to check your database connection string and ensure that it is pointing to the correct database.
