Having separate pipelines for specific requests is not necessarily a bad practice. In fact, it can be a good practice to keep the logic for each request separate and organized. 

However, it's important to consider the overall design and architecture of your application. If you find yourself creating many separate pipelines for different requests, it may be a sign that your application is becoming too complex and difficult to maintain. 

In such cases, you may want to consider refactoring your code to make it more modular and reusable. One approach could be to create a base pipeline that handles common logic, and then have separate pipelines for specific requests that inherit from the base pipeline and add their own unique logic.

Ultimately, the decision to have separate pipelines for specific requests depends on the specific needs and requirements of your application.
