The error message is caused by the `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` line in your `OnModelCreating` method. You cannot create an index on a navigation property like `Gender` because it is not a scalar property.

To fix this issue, you need to specify which property of the `Gender` entity you want to create an index on. For example, if you want to create an index on the `Id` property of the `Gender` entity, you can modify your `OnModelCreating` method like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);
    }

    modelBuilder.Entity<Gender>()
        .HasIndex(g => g.Id);

    base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
}
```

This will create an index on the `Id` property of the `Gender` entity, which is a scalar property and can be indexed.
