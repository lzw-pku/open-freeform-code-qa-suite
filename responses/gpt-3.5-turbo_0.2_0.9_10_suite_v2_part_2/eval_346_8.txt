This error occurs because IntelliJ is using an older version of Maven than the one used by the Spring Boot project. To fix this, you can try updating the Maven version in IntelliJ to match the one used by the project. You can do this by going to File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven and selecting the correct version. Alternatively, you can try updating the Maven version used by the Spring Boot project to match the one used by IntelliJ.
