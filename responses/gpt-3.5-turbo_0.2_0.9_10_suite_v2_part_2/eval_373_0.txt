It seems that you have a version conflict between the Hibernate Validator version that is included in your Spring Boot parent pom and the version that is resolved by Maven. 

The Spring Boot 2.0.4.RELEASE parent pom includes Hibernate Validator 6.0.10.Final, while your Maven dependencies include version 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2. 

To solve this issue, you can exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from your pom.xml and let Spring Boot manage the version for you. 

You can do this by adding the following exclusion to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <!-- Exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency -->
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

This will exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from the Spring Boot starter web dependency, and Spring Boot will use the version that is included in the parent pom.
