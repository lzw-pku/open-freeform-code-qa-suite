You can use the `JsonResult` class to return JSON with a HTTP status code in your .NET Core Web API controller. Here's an example:

```c#
public JsonResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return new JsonResult("123")
    {
        StatusCode = 200
    };
}
```

In this example, we are creating a new `JsonResult` object and setting its value to `"123"`. We are also setting the `StatusCode` property to `200` to indicate a successful response.

You can also use the `Ok` method to return a JSON result with a HTTP status code:

```c#
public IActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return Ok("123");
}
```

This will return a JSON result with a HTTP status code of `200`. If you want to return a different status code, you can use the `StatusCode` method:

```c#
public IActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return StatusCode(401, "Unauthorized");
}
```

This will return a JSON result with a HTTP status code of `401` and a value of `"Unauthorized"`.
