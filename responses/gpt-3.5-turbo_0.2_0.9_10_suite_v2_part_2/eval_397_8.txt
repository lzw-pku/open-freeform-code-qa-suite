The error message is caused by the following line in your `OnModelCreating` method:
```c#
user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);
```
You are trying to create an index on the `Gender` property, which is actually a navigation property. You should create the index on the `GenderId` property instead:
```c#
user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
```
This should solve the problem.
