The error message suggests that Jackson (the JSON serializer/deserializer used by Spring) cannot serialize the `ByteArrayInputStream` object that is part of the `MultipartFile` object. 

To solve this, you can configure Jackson to ignore the `ByteArrayInputStream` property by adding the following line to your application configuration:

```java
spring.jackson.serialization.fail-on-empty-beans=false
```

Alternatively, you can exclude the `ByteArrayInputStream` property from serialization by annotating the `MultipartFile` field with `@JsonIgnore`:

```java
@JsonIgnore
private MultipartFile circularAttachment;
```

Note that excluding the `ByteArrayInputStream` property from serialization may cause some data loss, as the content of the input stream will not be sent to the microservice. If you need to send the content of the input stream, you may need to use a different serialization format, such as binary or base64-encoded data.
