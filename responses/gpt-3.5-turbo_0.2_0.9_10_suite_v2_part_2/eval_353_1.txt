The error message suggests that the `--add-opens` option is not recognized by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that is being used to run Hyperledger Besu. This option is used to open packages that are not accessible by default in Java 9 and later.

Hyperledger Besu requires Java 11 or later to run, so you should check that you have installed the correct version of Java. You can check the version of Java that is being used by running the following command:

```shell
java -version
```

If the version is not Java 11 or later, you should install the correct version and set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the installation directory of Java 11 or later.

Once you have installed the correct version of Java and set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, try running the `bin\besu --help` command again. If you still encounter the same error, you may need to check the version of Hyperledger Besu that you have installed and ensure that it is compatible with the version of Java that you have installed.
