The error message indicates that the `Keys` table is missing in the database. This could be caused by a migration issue during the upgrade process.

To solve this problem, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio by going to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console.

2. Run the following command to generate a new migration:

   ```
   Add-Migration AddKeysTable
   ```

3. Run the following command to apply the migration to the database:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

   This will create the `Keys` table in the database.

If the above steps do not work, you can try deleting the existing migrations and generating a new one:

1. Delete all existing migrations in the Migrations folder.

2. Run the following command to generate a new migration:

   ```
   Add-Migration InitialCreate
   ```

3. Run the following command to apply the migration to the database:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

   This will create all the necessary tables in the database, including the `Keys` table.

If the issue still persists, you may need to check your database connection string and ensure that it is pointing to the correct database.
