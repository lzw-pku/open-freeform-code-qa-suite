This error occurs because IntelliJ is using an older version of Maven than the one used by Spring Boot 2.7. To fix this, you can try updating the Maven version in IntelliJ to match the one used by Spring Boot 2.7. You can do this by going to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven and selecting the correct version. If that doesn't work, you can try deleting the .idea folder in your project directory and re-importing the project into IntelliJ.
