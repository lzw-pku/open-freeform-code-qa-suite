There are a few things you can check to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Make sure that the `@EnableSwagger2WebMvc` annotation is present in your Spring Boot application configuration class. This annotation enables Swagger support for your application.

2. Check that the `@ComponentScan` annotation in your configuration class includes the package where your controllers are located. Swagger needs to scan your controllers to generate the API documentation.

3. Verify that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.path` property is set to `/swagger-ui.html` in your `application.properties` file. This is the default path for the Swagger UI.

4. Check that the `@RestController` annotation is present on your controller classes. Swagger only generates documentation for RESTful APIs.

5. If you're using Spring Security, make sure that you've configured it to allow access to the Swagger UI and API documentation endpoints.

If none of these steps solve the issue, you can try enabling debug logging for the `springfox` package to see if there are any errors or warnings related to Swagger initialization.
