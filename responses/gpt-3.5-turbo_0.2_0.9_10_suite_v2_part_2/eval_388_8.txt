The error message indicates that the `Keys` table is missing in the database. This could be caused by a migration issue during the upgrade process.

To solve this problem, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio.
2. Run the following command to generate a new migration:

   ```
   Add-Migration AddKeysTable
   ```

3. Run the following command to apply the migration:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

This should create the `Keys` table in the database and resolve the error. If the issue persists, you may need to check your database connection string and ensure that it is pointing to the correct database.
