You can use the `JsonResult` class to return JSON with a specific HTTP status code in your .NET Core Web API controller. Here's an example:

```c#
public JsonResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return new JsonResult("123")
    {
        StatusCode = 200
    };
}
```

In this example, we're creating a new `JsonResult` object and setting its `StatusCode` property to 200 (OK). We're also passing the JSON data ("123") to the constructor of the `JsonResult` object.

You can also use the `Ok` method to return a JSON result with a 200 status code, like this:

```c#
public IActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return Ok("123");
}
```

This code is equivalent to the previous example, but it uses the `Ok` method to return a JSON result with a 200 status code. The `Ok` method is a shorthand for creating a new `JsonResult` object and setting its `StatusCode` property to 200.
