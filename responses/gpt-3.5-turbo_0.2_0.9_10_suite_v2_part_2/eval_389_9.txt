The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0, so make sure you are using EF Core 5.0 or later. If you are using an earlier version of EF Core, the `[Keyless]` attribute will not be available.

To check the version of EF Core that you are using, you can go to your project's `csproj` file and look for the `PackageReference` section. If you are using Visual Studio, you can also check the version of EF Core by going to the `Dependencies` section of your project and looking for the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` package.

If you are using an earlier version of EF Core, you can still create keyless entities by using the `HasNoKey()` method in your `OnModelCreating` method, like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<MyKeylessClass>().HasNoKey();
}
```

This will tell EF Core that the entity does not have a primary key, and you can use it with the `FromSqlRaw` method.
