@Configuration should be used when you need to define beans that require additional configuration beyond what is possible with the other annotations. This includes defining beans that require complex initialization logic, or when you need to create and configure multiple related beans together. Additionally, @Configuration can be used to import other configuration classes and to define bean post-processors.
