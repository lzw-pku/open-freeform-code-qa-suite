You can use an open generic type to register your generic interface in the DI container. Here's an example of how to do it:
```c#
services.AddScoped(typeof(IDatabaseService<>), typeof(YourDatabaseService<>));
```
This registers `YourDatabaseService<T>` as the implementation for `IDatabaseService<T>`. The `<>` syntax indicates that the interface is open and can be used with any type.
