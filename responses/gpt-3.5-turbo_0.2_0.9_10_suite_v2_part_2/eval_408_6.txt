The error message is caused by the fact that you are trying to create an index on the `Gender` property of the `User` entity, which is not allowed because `Gender` is a navigation property.

To solve this problem, you can remove the line that creates the index on the `Gender` property and instead create an index on the `GenderId` property, like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    }
}
```

This will create an index on the `GenderId` property, which is the foreign key to the `Gender` entity, and should solve the problem.
