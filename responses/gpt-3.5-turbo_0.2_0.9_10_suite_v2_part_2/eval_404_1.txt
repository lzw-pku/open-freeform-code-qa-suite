You can use the `JsonResult` class to return JSON with a specific HTTP status code in your .NET Core Web API controller. Here's an example:

```c#
public JsonResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return new JsonResult("123")
    {
        StatusCode = 200
    };
}
```

In this example, we create a new instance of the `JsonResult` class and pass in the JSON data as a parameter. We then set the `StatusCode` property to the desired HTTP status code (in this case, 200).

You can also set other properties of the `JsonResult` object, such as `ContentType` and `SerializerSettings`, if needed.

Note that the `ActionResult` class is a base class for action results in ASP.NET Core, and it doesn't have a `Json` method. That's why you were getting the weird response from the server.
