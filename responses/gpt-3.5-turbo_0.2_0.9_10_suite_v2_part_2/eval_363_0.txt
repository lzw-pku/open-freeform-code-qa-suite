The error message you are seeing is related to the Spring Cloud Config feature, which is used to externalize configuration properties in a distributed system. It seems that the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency is causing this issue.

To fix this error, you can try one of the following options:

1. Remove the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency if you are not using Spring Cloud Config in your project. This should resolve the error.

2. If you are using Spring Cloud Config, you need to provide the `spring.config.import` property to specify the location of the configuration server. You can add the following property to your `application.properties` file:

   ```
   spring.config.import=optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888
   ```

   This will import the configuration from the Config Server running on `http://localhost:8888`. You can replace this URL with the actual URL of your Config Server.

   Alternatively, you can set this property as a system property or environment variable when running your tests:

   ```
   -Dspring.config.import=optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888
   ```

   This will set the `spring.config.import` property to the specified value when running your tests.

I hope this helps!
