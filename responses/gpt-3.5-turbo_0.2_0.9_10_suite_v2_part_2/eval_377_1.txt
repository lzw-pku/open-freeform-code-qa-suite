It seems like IntelliJ IDEA is still using the old version of Java (1.8) to compile your code. You need to configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the new JDK 11. 

To do this, go to `File > Project Structure > SDKs` and click on the `+` button to add a new SDK. Select `JDK` and navigate to the directory where you installed JDK 11 (`C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1` in your case). Once you have added the new SDK, go to `File > Project Structure > Project` and select the new SDK as the `Project SDK`. 

After doing this, try building your application again. If you still get the same error, make sure that the `Project bytecode version` in `settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler` is set to 11.
