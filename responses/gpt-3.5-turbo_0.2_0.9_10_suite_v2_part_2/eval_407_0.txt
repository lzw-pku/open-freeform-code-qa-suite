In a .NET 6 Console Application, you can use the `Host` class to create a host for your application and configure it to read configuration from your `appsettings.json` file.

Here's an example of how you can do this in your `Program.cs` file:

```c#
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

var builder = new HostBuilder()
    .ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>
    {
        config.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true);
    })
    .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =>
    {
        // Add your services here
    });

await builder.RunConsoleAsync();
```

This code creates a `HostBuilder` instance and configures it to read configuration from the `appsettings.json` file. You can add additional configuration sources if needed.

Then, you can add your services to the `ConfigureServices` method.

Finally, you can start the host by calling `RunConsoleAsync()`. This will run your console application and keep it running until you stop it manually.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
