The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you are using an earlier version of Entity Framework Core, you will not have access to this attribute. 

To use `[Keyless]`, you need to ensure that you are using Entity Framework Core 5.0 or later. You can check your version of Entity Framework Core by looking at the version number of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` package in your project's dependencies.

If you are using an earlier version of Entity Framework Core, you can still create keyless entities by creating a class that does not have a primary key property and then using the `ModelBuilder` to configure the entity as keyless. Here's an example:

```c#
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string Property1 { get; set; }
    public int Property2 { get; set; }
}

protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<MyKeylessClass>().HasNoKey();
}
```

With this configuration, you can use `FromSqlRaw` to query the keyless entity without having to add a primary key.
