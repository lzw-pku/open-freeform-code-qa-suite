It's possible that the XML format is not properly configured in your Spring Boot project. You can check if the Jackson XML library is included in your project dependencies and if it is properly configured in your Spring Boot application. You can also try adding the `produces = {"application/xml"}` parameter to your `@GetMapping` annotation to explicitly specify that the endpoint should produce XML.
