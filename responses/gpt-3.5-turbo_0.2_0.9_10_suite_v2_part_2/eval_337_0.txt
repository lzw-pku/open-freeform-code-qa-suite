Here's the implementation of the `createPriorityQueue` function in Java:

```java
public static PriorityQueue<Pair<Integer, Integer>> createPriorityQueue() {
    return new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a.getKey() - b.getKey());
}
```

This function creates a new `PriorityQueue` of integer pairs, where the smallest key of pairs is considered as priority. The lambda expression `(a, b) -> a.getKey() - b.getKey()` is used to compare the integer pairs based on their keys, which is the first element of the pair. The `getKey()` method is used to access the key of each pair.
