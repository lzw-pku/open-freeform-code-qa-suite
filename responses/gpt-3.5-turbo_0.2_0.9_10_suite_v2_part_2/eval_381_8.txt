There are a few things you can check to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Make sure that the Spring Boot application is running and accessible at localhost:8080. You can check this by accessing localhost:8080 in your browser and seeing if the application is up and running.

2. Check that the `@EnableSwagger2` annotation is present in your Spring Boot application. This annotation is required to enable Swagger support in your application.

3. Verify that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.path` property is set correctly in your application.properties file. By default, the path is set to `/swagger-ui.html`, but it can be changed to a different value if needed.

4. Check that the `@OpenAPIDefinition` annotation is present in your Spring Boot application. This annotation is required to define the OpenAPI specification for your application.

5. Verify that the `@ComponentScan` annotation is present in your Spring Boot application. This annotation is required to scan for the SpringDoc components and register them with the Spring context.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you can try adding the following configuration to your application.properties file:

```
springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled=true
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/swagger-ui/index.html
```

This will enable the Swagger UI and set the path to `/swagger-ui/index.html`.
