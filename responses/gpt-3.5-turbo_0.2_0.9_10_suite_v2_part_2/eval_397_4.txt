The error message is indicating that you cannot create an index on the `Gender` property of the `User` entity because it is already being used as a navigation property to the `Gender` entity. 

To solve this problem, you can create an index on the `GenderId` property instead, which is the foreign key to the `Gender` entity. 

Replace the line `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` with `user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);` in your `OnModelCreating` method. 

Here is the updated code:
```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);
    }

    user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
}
``` 

Now, when you run `dotnet ef add migration User`, it should work without any errors.
