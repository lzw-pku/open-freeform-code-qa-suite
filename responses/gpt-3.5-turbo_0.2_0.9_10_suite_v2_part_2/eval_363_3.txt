The error message suggests that the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor` is trying to import configuration from a ConfigServer, but it cannot find the `spring.config.import` property. This is likely because the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency is included in your project, which enables the ConfigClient to fetch configuration from a ConfigServer.

To fix this issue, you can either:

1. Remove the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency from your project if you are not using it.
2. Set the `spring.config.import` property to an empty value in your test properties, like this:

   ```java
   @SpringBootTest(
       webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT,
       classes = {
           ProductCompositeServiceApplication.class,
           TestSecurityConfig.class },
       properties = {
           "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true",
           "spring.config.import=" })
   ```

   This will tell the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor` not to import any configuration from a ConfigServer.
