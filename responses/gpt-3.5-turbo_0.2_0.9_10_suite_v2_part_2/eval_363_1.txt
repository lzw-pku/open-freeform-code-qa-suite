The error message indicates that the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor` is trying to import configuration from a ConfigServer, but it cannot find the `spring.config.import` property. This is likely because the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency is included in your project, which enables the ConfigClient by default.

To fix this issue, you can exclude the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency from your project. You can do this by adding the following line to your `build.gradle` file:

```
implementation('org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-config') {
    exclude group: 'org.springframework.cloud', module: 'spring-cloud-config-client'
}
```

This will exclude the `spring-cloud-config-client` module, which is responsible for enabling the ConfigClient. With this module excluded, the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor` will not try to import configuration from a ConfigServer, and the `spring.config.import` property will not be required.

After making this change, you should be able to run your tests without encountering the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor$ImportException` error.
