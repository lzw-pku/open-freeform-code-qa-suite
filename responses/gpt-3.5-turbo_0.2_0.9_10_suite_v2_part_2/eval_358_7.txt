Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it ensures that the dependencies are injected at the time of object creation and makes the class immutable. It also makes the code more readable and easier to test. However, if you are using Spring 4.3 or later, you can omit the `@Autowired` annotation on the constructor if the class has only one constructor. In this case, Spring will automatically inject the dependencies.
