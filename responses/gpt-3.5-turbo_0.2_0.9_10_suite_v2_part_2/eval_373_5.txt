It seems that you have two different versions of Hibernate Validator in your classpath. One is version 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2, which is provided by JBoss, and the other is version 6.0.11, which is resolved by Maven.

To solve this issue, you can exclude the JBoss-provided Hibernate Validator from your dependencies by adding the following exclusion to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

Then, you can add the latest version of Hibernate Validator as a direct dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

This should ensure that you have only one version of Hibernate Validator in your classpath and that it is the latest version.
