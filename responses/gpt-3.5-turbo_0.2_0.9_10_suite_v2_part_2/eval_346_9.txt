This error occurs because IntelliJ is using an older version of Maven (3.6.3) which is not compatible with Spring Boot 2.7. To fix this, you can either upgrade your IntelliJ to the latest version or manually update the Maven version in IntelliJ to 3.8.5. To update the Maven version in IntelliJ, go to Preferences > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven and change the "Maven home directory" to the location of your Maven 3.8.5 installation.
