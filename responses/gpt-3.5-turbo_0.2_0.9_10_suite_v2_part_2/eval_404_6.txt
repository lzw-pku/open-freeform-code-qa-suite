You can use the `JsonResult` class to return JSON with a specific HTTP status code. Here's an example:

```c#
public IActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return new JsonResult("123")
    {
        StatusCode = 200 // or any other HTTP status code you want to return
    };
}
```

In this example, we're creating a new `JsonResult` object and setting its `Value` property to `"123"`. We're also setting the `StatusCode` property to `200` to indicate a successful response. You can set any other HTTP status code that you need.

Note that we're using `IActionResult` as the return type instead of `ActionResult`. This is because `IActionResult` is more flexible and allows you to return different types of results, not just `ActionResult`.
