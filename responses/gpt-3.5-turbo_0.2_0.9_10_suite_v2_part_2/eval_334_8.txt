```java
public static void removeFalseSubjects(List<Subject> subjects){
    subjects.removeIf(subject -> !subject.isStatus());
}
```
This code uses the `removeIf` method of the `List` interface to remove all elements that do not have a `status` of `true`. The lambda expression `subject -> !subject.isStatus()` is used as the predicate to determine which elements should be removed. It checks if the `status` of the `Subject` object is `false` and returns `true` if it is, which causes the element to be removed.
