You can return a JSON response with a specific HTTP status code in your .NET Core Web API controller by using the `JsonResult` class. Here's an example:

```c#
public JsonResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return new JsonResult("123")
    {
        StatusCode = 200 // or any other HTTP status code
    };
}
```

In this example, we're creating a new `JsonResult` object and setting its `Value` property to `"123"`. We're also setting the `StatusCode` property to `200` to indicate a successful response.

You can also use the `Ok` method to return a JSON response with a `200` status code, like this:

```c#
public IActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return Ok("123");
}
```

In this case, we're using the `Ok` method to create a new `OkObjectResult` object with a `200` status code and setting its `Value` property to `"123"`.
