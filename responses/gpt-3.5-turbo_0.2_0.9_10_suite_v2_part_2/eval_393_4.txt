Having two separate pipelines for two specific requests is not necessarily a bad practice. In fact, it can be a good practice as it allows you to have more control over the behavior of each pipeline and keep the logic separate.

However, if you find that you have many different pipelines for different requests, it may become difficult to manage and maintain. In that case, you may want to consider refactoring your code to have a more generic pipeline that can handle multiple types of requests and responses.

Ultimately, the decision to have separate pipelines or a more generic one depends on the specific requirements of your application and the complexity of your code.
