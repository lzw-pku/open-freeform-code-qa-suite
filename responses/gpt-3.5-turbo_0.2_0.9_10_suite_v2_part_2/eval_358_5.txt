Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and easier to maintain. It clearly indicates that the class has a dependency on another class and that dependency is injected through the constructor. Additionally, it ensures that the dependency is mandatory and must be provided at the time of object creation. This helps to avoid null pointer exceptions and other issues that may arise due to missing dependencies. However, if you prefer not to use `@Autowired`, you can still inject dependencies using setter methods or field injection.
