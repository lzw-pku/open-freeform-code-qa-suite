You can specify the Java version to use with the Maven wrapper by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path of the desired JDK installation. 

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Locate the path of the JDK installation that works with the Maven task. This can typically be found in the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable of the shell or command prompt where you run the Maven task.

2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path of the JDK installation. For example, if the path is `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`, you can set the variable by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
   ```

   If you are using Windows, you can set the variable by going to Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables, and adding a new system variable with the name `JAVA_HOME` and the value of the JDK installation path.

3. Run the Maven wrapper command as usual. It should now use the specified JDK version.

Note that if you are using an IDE, you may need to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable in the IDE's settings or configuration as well.
