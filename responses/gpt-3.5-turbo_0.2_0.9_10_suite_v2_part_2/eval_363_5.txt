The error message indicates that the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor` is trying to import configuration from a Config Server, but it cannot find the `spring.config.import` property. This property is used to specify the location of the Config Server, and it is required if you are using the Spring Cloud Config client.

Since you are not using the Config Server, you can disable the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor` by adding the following property to your test configuration:

```
@SpringBootTest(
    webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT,
    classes = {
        ProductCompositeServiceApplication.class,
        TestSecurityConfig.class },
    properties = {
        "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true",
        "spring.cloud.config.enabled=false" })
```

This will disable the Spring Cloud Config client and prevent the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor` from running.
