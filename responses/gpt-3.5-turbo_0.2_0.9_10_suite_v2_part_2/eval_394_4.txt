The error message is indicating that you cannot use the `Gender` property as a regular property on the `User` entity because it is already configured as a navigation property. 

To fix this error, you can remove the line `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` from your `OnModelCreating` method. This line is trying to create an index on the `Gender` property, but since it is a navigation property, it cannot be indexed directly. 

If you need to search for users by gender, you can create an index on the `GenderId` property instead. You can add the following line to your `OnModelCreating` method to create an index on `GenderId`:

```
user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
``` 

After making these changes, you should be able to run `dotnet ef add migration User` without any errors.
