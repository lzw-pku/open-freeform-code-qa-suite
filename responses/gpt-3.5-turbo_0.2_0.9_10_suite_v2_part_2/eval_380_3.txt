In Java 8, you can use the `getClass()` method to get the class of an object. Here's an example:

```java
Object obj = "hello";
Class<?> clazz = obj.getClass();
System.out.println(clazz.getName()); // prints "java.lang.String"
```

This will work for any object, including primitive wrappers like `Integer` and `Float`. However, it won't work for primitive types like `int` and `float`. For those, you can use the `getTypeName()` method of the `Class` object:

```java
int i = 42;
Class<?> clazz = int.class;
System.out.println(clazz.getTypeName()); // prints "int"
```

Note that `getTypeName()` was added in Java 8, so it won't work in earlier versions of Java.
