The error message suggests that there is an issue with the path to the `mvn.cmd` file. It seems that the path contains quotes that are causing the error.

One solution is to use the short name of the directory instead of the long name with spaces. You can find the short name by running the following command in the command prompt:

```
dir C:\ /x
```

This will list all the directories in the C:\ drive along with their short names. Look for the directory that contains NetBeans and use its short name in the command.

For example, if the short name for "Program Files" is "PROGRA~1", you can modify the command as follows:

```
cd C:\projects\open; "JAVA_HOME=C:\\PROGRA~1\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5" cmd /c "\"\"C:\\PROGRA~1\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd\" -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path=\"C:\\PROGRA~1\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar\" -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install\""
```

Alternatively, you can try enclosing the entire path to `mvn.cmd` in double quotes and escaping the inner quotes with a backslash:

```
cd C:\projects\open; "JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5" cmd /c "\"\"\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd\" -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path=\\\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar\\\" -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install\"\""
```

This should prevent the error caused by the embedded quotes.
