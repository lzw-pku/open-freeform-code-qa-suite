The error message suggests that there is an issue with the quotes in the command. It seems that the quotes are not properly escaped, causing the command to be interpreted incorrectly.

One possible solution is to use single quotes instead of double quotes to enclose the command. This way, the double quotes inside the command will not be interpreted as the end of the command.

Try modifying the command as follows:

```
cd C:\projects\open; "JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5" cmd /c "'C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd' -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path='C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar' -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install"
```

This should properly escape the quotes and allow the command to be executed without errors.
