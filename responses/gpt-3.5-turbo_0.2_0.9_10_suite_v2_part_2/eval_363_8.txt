The error message indicates that the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor` is looking for the `spring.config.import` property, which is not set in your project. This property is used to import configuration from a Config Server, and it seems that your project is not using a Config Server.

To fix this issue, you can set the `spring.cloud.config.enabled` property to `false` in your test properties. This will disable the Config Server configuration and prevent the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor` from looking for the `spring.config.import` property.

Here's an example of how to set the `spring.cloud.config.enabled` property in your test properties:

```java
@SpringBootTest(
    webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT,
    classes = {
        ProductCompositeServiceApplication.class,
        TestSecurityConfig.class },
    properties = {
        "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true",
        "spring.cloud.config.enabled=false" })
```

With this configuration, your tests should run without errors.
