The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0, so you need to make sure you are using EF Core 5.0 or later in your project. 

To check the version of EF Core in your project, you can open the Package Manager Console and run the following command:

```
Get-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -AllVersions
```

This will show you all the versions of EF Core that are installed in your project. Make sure that you have version 5.0 or later installed.

If you are using an earlier version of EF Core, you can either upgrade to version 5.0 or later, or you can use a workaround such as creating a dummy property in your model and marking it as the key using the `[Key]` attribute. This will allow you to use the `FromSqlRaw` method without having to add a real primary key to your model.
