Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It clearly indicates that the class has a dependency on another class and the Spring container should provide an instance of that dependency. Additionally, using constructor injection with `@Autowired` makes the class immutable, which can be beneficial for testing and thread-safety. However, if you prefer to use setter injection or field injection, those are also valid options in Spring.
