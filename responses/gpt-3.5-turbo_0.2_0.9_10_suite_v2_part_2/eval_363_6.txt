The error message indicates that the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor` is trying to import configuration from a Config Server, but it cannot find the `spring.config.import` property. This is likely because the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency is included in your project, but you are not using it.

To fix this issue, you can either remove the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency from your `build.gradle` file, or add the `spring.config.import` property to your test properties.

To add the `spring.config.import` property to your test properties, you can modify your `@SpringBootTest` annotation as follows:

```java
@SpringBootTest(
    webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT,
    classes = {
        ProductCompositeServiceApplication.class,
        TestSecurityConfig.class },
    properties = {
        "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true",
        "spring.config.import=" })
```

Setting `spring.config.import` to an empty string will disable the Config Server import feature.
