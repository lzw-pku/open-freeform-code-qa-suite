The error message indicates that the `Keys` table is missing in your database. This could be caused by a migration issue during the upgrade process.

To solve this problem, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio by going to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console.

2. Run the following command to generate a new migration:

   ```
   Add-Migration AddKeysTable
   ```

3. Run the following command to apply the migration to the database:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

   This will create the `Keys` table in your database.

If the above steps do not solve the problem, you can try deleting the existing migration files and generating a new migration from scratch. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Delete all migration files in the Migrations folder of your project.

2. Run the following command to add a new initial migration:

   ```
   Add-Migration InitialCreate
   ```

3. Run the following command to apply the migration to the database:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

4. Run the following command to add a new migration for the `Keys` table:

   ```
   Add-Migration AddKeysTable
   ```

5. Run the following command to apply the migration to the database:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

This should solve the problem. If you still encounter issues, you may need to check your database connection string and ensure that it is pointing to the correct database.
