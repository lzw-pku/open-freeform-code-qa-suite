The error message suggests that Jackson (the JSON serializer/deserializer used by Spring) cannot serialize the `ByteArrayInputStream` object that is part of the `MultipartFile` object. 

To solve this, you can configure Jackson to ignore the `ByteArrayInputStream` property during serialization by adding the following line to your application configuration:

```java
objectMapper.configure(SerializationFeature.FAIL_ON_EMPTY_BEANS, false);
```

This will disable the `SerializationFeature.FAIL_ON_EMPTY_BEANS` feature, which causes Jackson to throw an exception when it encounters an empty bean during serialization. Since the `ByteArrayInputStream` property is not needed for serialization, it can be safely ignored.

You can also try to use a different `HttpMessageConverter` that can handle multipart requests, such as `org.springframework.http.converter.FormHttpMessageConverter`. To use this converter, you can add it to the `RestTemplate` instance as follows:

```java
RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
restTemplate.getMessageConverters().add(new FormHttpMessageConverter());
```

This will ensure that the `FormHttpMessageConverter` is used to handle multipart requests, which should be able to handle the `MultipartFile` object without any issues.
