There are a few things you can check to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Make sure that the `@EnableSwagger2` annotation is present in your Spring Boot application. This annotation is required to enable Swagger support.

2. Check that the `@ComponentScan` annotation is scanning the package where your Swagger configuration is located. By default, Swagger configuration should be located in the same package as your Spring Boot application class.

3. Verify that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.path` property is set to `/swagger-ui.html` in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file. This is the default path for the Swagger UI.

4. Check that the `@RestController` or `@Controller` classes in your application have the `@ApiOperation` annotation present on their methods. This annotation is used to generate the Swagger documentation.

5. Finally, make sure that the application is running on the correct port. By default, Spring Boot applications run on port 8080, but this can be changed in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.
