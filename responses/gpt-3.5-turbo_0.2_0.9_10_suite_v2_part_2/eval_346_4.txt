This error occurs because IntelliJ is using an older version of Maven than the one used to generate the project. To fix this, you can try updating the Maven version in IntelliJ to match the one used in the project. You can do this by going to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven and selecting the correct version. If that doesn't work, you can try deleting the `.idea` folder in the project directory and re-importing the project into IntelliJ.
