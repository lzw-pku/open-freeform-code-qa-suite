It seems like IntelliJ is still using the old version of Java (1.8) to compile your code. You need to configure IntelliJ to use the new JDK 11.

Here are the steps to add JDK 11 to IntelliJ:

1. Go to `File > Project Structure > SDKs`.
2. Click on the `+` button and select `JDK`.
3. Navigate to the directory where you installed JDK 11 (`C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1`) and select it.
4. Click `OK` to save the new SDK.

Now you need to configure your project to use the new SDK:

1. Go to `File > Project Structure > Project`.
2. In the `Project SDK` dropdown, select the new JDK 11 SDK you just added.
3. Click `OK` to save the changes.

Now IntelliJ should be using JDK 11 to compile your code.
