There are a few things you can check to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Make sure that the `@EnableSwagger2WebMvc` annotation is present in your Spring Boot application class.

2. Check that the `@ComponentScan` annotation is scanning the package where your Swagger configuration class is located.

3. Verify that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.path` property is not set to a different value in your application.properties or application.yml file. By default, it should be set to `/swagger-ui.html`.

4. Ensure that the version of the `springdoc-openapi-ui` dependency matches the version of the `springdoc-openapi-core` dependency that you are using.

5. Check that there are no conflicts with other dependencies that may be interfering with the Swagger UI.

If none of these steps solve the issue, you can try enabling debug logging to get more information about what might be going wrong. You can do this by adding the following line to your application.properties or application.yml file:

```
logging.level.org.springdoc=DEBUG
``` 

This will enable debug logging for the `springdoc` package, which should provide more information about what is happening when you try to access the Swagger UI.
