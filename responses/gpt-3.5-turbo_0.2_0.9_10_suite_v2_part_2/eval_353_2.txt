The error message suggests that the `--add-opens` option is not recognized by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that is being used to run Hyperledger Besu. This option is used to open a package in the JDK that is not open by default.

One possible solution is to upgrade your Java version to a more recent version that supports the `--add-opens` option. Hyperledger Besu requires Java 11 or later, so you could try installing Java 11 or Java 14 and setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the installation directory of the new version.

To check if the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set, you can run the following command in the terminal:
```
echo %JAVA_HOME%
```

If it is not set, you can set it by following these steps:
1. Find the installation directory of the new Java version.
2. Open the Control Panel and go to System and Security > System > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables.
3. Under System Variables, click New and enter `JAVA_HOME` as the variable name and the installation directory as the variable value.
4. Click OK to save the changes.

After setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, you can try running the `bin\besu --help` command again and see if the issue is resolved.
