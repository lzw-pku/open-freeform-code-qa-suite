The error message indicates that the `Keys` table is missing in the database. This could be caused by a database migration issue during the upgrade process.

To solve this problem, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio by going to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console.

2. Run the following command to generate a new migration:

   ```
   Add-Migration AddKeysTable
   ```

3. Run the following command to apply the migration to the database:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

   This will create the `Keys` table in the database if it doesn't exist.

If the above steps don't solve the problem, you can try deleting the database and creating a new one by running the following commands in the Package Manager Console:

```
Drop-Database
Update-Database
```

Note that this will delete all data in the database, so make sure to backup any important data before running these commands.
