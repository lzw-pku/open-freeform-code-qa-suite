You need to register the `ILogger` service in the `ServiceCollection` before building the `ServiceProvider`. You can do this by adding the `ILoggerFactory` to the `ServiceCollection` and then using it to create an `ILogger` instance. Here's an example:

```c#
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddLogging(logging =>
    {
        logging.AddConsole();
        logging.AddDebug();
    })
    .BuildServiceProvider();

ILoggerFactory loggerFactory = services.GetService<ILoggerFactory>();
ILogger logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger<MyClass>();
```

Then you can pass the `ILogger` instance to your class constructor.
