It seems that there might be a conflict between the version of Hibernate Validator that is being used and the version that is being resolved by Maven. 

You can try to explicitly exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from the Spring Boot starter validation dependency and add the desired version as a direct dependency in your pom.xml file. 

Here's an example of how to do this:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

This will exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from the Spring Boot starter validation and add the desired version as a direct dependency. 

Make sure to also update the version of the Hibernate Validator dependency in your bean's pom.xml file to match the version you added as a direct dependency.
