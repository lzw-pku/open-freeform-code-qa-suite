The error message suggests that the `--add-opens` option is not recognized by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that is being used to run Hyperledger Besu. This option is used to add a package to the set of open packages in the JVM, which is required by some modules in Besu.

The `--add-opens` option was introduced in Java 9, so it may not be recognized by your version of Java (1.8.0_241). You can try upgrading to a newer version of Java that supports this option, or you can try running Besu with the `--illegal-access=permit` option instead.

To run Besu with the `--illegal-access=permit` option, you can modify the `besu.bat` file in the `bin` directory of your Besu installation. Find the line that starts with `set JAVA_OPTS=` and add the following option to the end of the line:

```
--illegal-access=permit
```

Save the file and try running Besu again. This should allow Besu to run without the `--add-opens` option.
