In a .NET 6 Console Application, you can use the `Host` class to create a host for your application and configure it to read the appsettings.json file. Here's an example of how to do it:

```c#
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

var builder = new HostBuilder()
    .ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>
    {
        config.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true);
    })
    .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =>
    {
        // Add your services here
    });

var host = builder.Build();
```

In this example, we're using the `HostBuilder` class to create a host for our application. We're then using the `ConfigureAppConfiguration` method to configure the host to read the appsettings.json file. Finally, we're using the `ConfigureServices` method to add our services to the host.

Note that you'll need to add the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration` and `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting` packages to your project for this to work.
