In Java 8, you can use the `getClass()` method to get the class of an object. Here's an example:

```java
Object obj = "Hello";
Class<?> clazz = obj.getClass();
System.out.println(clazz.getName()); // prints "java.lang.String"
```

This will give you the class of the object, which you can then use to check its type. However, this approach won't work for primitive types, as they are not objects in Java.

Alternatively, you can use the `isInstance()` method of the `Class` class to check if an object is an instance of a particular class. Here's an example:

```java
Object obj = "Hello";
if (String.class.isInstance(obj)) {
    System.out.println("obj is a String");
}
```

This approach works for both objects and primitive types, as you can use the corresponding wrapper classes (e.g. `Integer.class` for `int`) to check their types.
