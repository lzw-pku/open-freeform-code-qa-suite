This error occurs because IntelliJ is using an older version of Maven than the one used by Spring Boot 2.7. To fix this, you can try updating the Maven version in IntelliJ to match the one used by Spring Boot 2.7. You can do this by going to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven and selecting the correct version of Maven. If this doesn't work, you can try deleting the IntelliJ cache and restarting IntelliJ.
