There are a few things you can check to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Make sure that the `@EnableSwagger2` annotation is present in your Spring Boot application. This annotation enables Swagger support in your application.

2. Check that the `@ComponentScan` annotation is scanning the correct package where your Swagger configuration is located.

3. Verify that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.path` property is set to `/swagger-ui.html` in your `application.properties` file. This is the default path for the Swagger UI.

4. Check that the `@OpenAPIDefinition` annotation is present in your Swagger configuration class. This annotation is required to generate the OpenAPI specification.

5. Verify that the `@SwaggerDefinition` annotation is not present in your Swagger configuration class. This annotation is deprecated and can cause conflicts with the `@OpenAPIDefinition` annotation.

6. Check that the `@RestController` or `@Controller` annotations are present in your controller classes. Swagger generates documentation based on these annotations.

7. Verify that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled` property is set to `true` in your `application.properties` file. This property enables the Swagger UI.

If none of these solutions work, you can try to debug your application to see if there are any errors or exceptions being thrown.
