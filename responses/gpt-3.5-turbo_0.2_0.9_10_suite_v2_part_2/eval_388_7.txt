The error message indicates that the `Keys` table is missing in the database. You can try the following steps to solve the problem:

1. Check if the `Keys` table exists in the database. You can use a SQLite client or command-line tool to connect to the database and execute the following SQL command:

   ```
   SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='Keys';
   ```

   If the table does not exist, you need to create it. You can use the following SQL command to create the table:

   ```
   CREATE TABLE "Keys" (
       "Id" TEXT NOT NULL CONSTRAINT "PK_Keys" PRIMARY KEY,
       "Algorithm" TEXT NOT NULL,
       "Created" INTEGER NOT NULL,
       "Data" BLOB NOT NULL,
       "DataProtected" BLOB,
       "IsX509Certificate" INTEGER NOT NULL,
       "Use" TEXT NOT NULL,
       "Version" TEXT NOT NULL
   );
   ```

2. If the table exists, check if the table name is correct. It's possible that the table name has been changed in the code or configuration files. Make sure that the table name in the SQL query matches the actual table name in the database.

3. If the table name is correct, check if the database connection string is correct. It's possible that the database file has been moved or renamed, or the connection string has been changed in the code or configuration files. Make sure that the connection string points to the correct database file and includes the correct table prefix (if any).

4. If none of the above steps solve the problem, try to recreate the database from scratch. You can use the following commands to delete the existing database file and create a new one:

   ```
   dotnet ef database drop
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

   Note that this will delete all data in the database, so make sure to back up any important data before running these commands.
