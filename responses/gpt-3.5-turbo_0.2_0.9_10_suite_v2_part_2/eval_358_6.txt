Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended best practice in Spring. It makes the code more readable and less error-prone. By using `@Autowired` on the constructor, you can ensure that all required dependencies are injected at the time of object creation. This helps to avoid null pointer exceptions and other issues that can arise when dependencies are not properly initialized. Additionally, it makes the code more testable, as you can easily inject mock dependencies for testing purposes.
