The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property, which is what `Gender` is in the `User` entity. To fix this issue, you need to specify the property of the `Gender` entity that you want to use for the index. Here's an updated version of your `OnModelCreating` method that should work:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);
    }

    modelBuilder.Entity<User>()
        .HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
}
```

In this updated version, we are creating an index on the `GenderId` property of the `User` entity, which is a simple integer property and can be indexed.
