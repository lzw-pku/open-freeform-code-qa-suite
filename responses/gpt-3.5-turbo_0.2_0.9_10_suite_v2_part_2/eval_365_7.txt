If you want to use the same version of Java that is used by the Maven task, you can specify the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the correct JDK installation. 

To do this, you can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk
```

Replace `/path/to/jdk` with the actual path to your JDK installation. 

Alternatively, if you are using Windows, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable through the System Properties dialog. 

1. Right-click on "My Computer" or "This PC" and select "Properties".
2. Click on "Advanced system settings".
3. Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
4. Under "System Variables", click "New".
5. Enter `JAVA_HOME` as the variable name and the path to your JDK installation as the variable value.
6. Click "OK" to save the changes.

Once you have set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, you should be able to run the Maven wrapper using the correct version of Java.
