The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you are using an earlier version of Entity Framework Core, you will not have access to this attribute. 

To use `[Keyless]`, you need to ensure that you are using Entity Framework Core 5.0 or later. You can check the version of Entity Framework Core that you are using by looking at the package version in your project's dependencies.

If you are using an earlier version of Entity Framework Core, you can still create keyless entities by defining a query type using the `EntityTypeBuilder.HasNoKey` method in your `OnModelCreating` method. Here's an example:

```c#
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Query<MyKeylessClass>().ToView("MyView");
}
```

In this example, `MyKeylessClass` is a keyless entity that is mapped to a database view called `MyView`. You can then use `FromSqlRaw` to query this view:

```c#
var results = context.Set<MyKeylessClass>().FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM MyView").ToList();
```
