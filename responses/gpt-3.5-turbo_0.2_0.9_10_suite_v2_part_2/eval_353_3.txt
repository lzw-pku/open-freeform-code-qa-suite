The error message suggests that the `--add-opens` option is not recognized by the Java Virtual Machine. This option is used by Hyperledger Besu to open packages that are not accessible by default due to Java's module system. 

It's possible that the version of Java you have installed does not support this option. The `--add-opens` option was introduced in Java 9, so if you're using Java 8, it won't work. 

You can try upgrading to a newer version of Java that supports this option. Alternatively, you can try using an older version of Hyperledger Besu that doesn't use this option. 

You can also try running the command without the `--add-opens` option to see if it works. However, this may cause other issues if the required packages are not opened.
