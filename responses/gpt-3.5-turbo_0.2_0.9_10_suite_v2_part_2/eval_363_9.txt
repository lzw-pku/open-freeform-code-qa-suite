The error message indicates that Spring Cloud Config is trying to import configuration from a Config Server, but it cannot find the `spring.config.import` property. This property is used to specify the location of the Config Server, and it is required if you are using Spring Cloud Config.

Since you mentioned that your project is not a Config Server and does not use Config Server, you can disable Spring Cloud Config by excluding the `ConfigServerAutoConfiguration` class from your application. You can do this by adding the following annotation to your test class:

```java
@SpringBootTest(
    webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT,
    classes = {
        ProductCompositeServiceApplication.class,
        TestSecurityConfig.class },
    properties = {
        "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true" })
@AutoConfigureWebTestClient
@EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude = ConfigServerAutoConfiguration.class)
public class MyTest {
    // ...
}
```

This will exclude the `ConfigServerAutoConfiguration` class from your application, which should prevent Spring Cloud Config from trying to import configuration from a Config Server.
