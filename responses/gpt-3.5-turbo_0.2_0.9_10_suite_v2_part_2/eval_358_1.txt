Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It clearly indicates that the dependency is required for the class to function properly. Additionally, it allows for easier testing as dependencies can be easily mocked or substituted in tests. However, if you prefer not to use `@Autowired`, you can still use constructor injection without it.
