You need to register the `ILogger` service in the `ServiceCollection` before building the `ServiceProvider`. You can do this by adding the following line to your configuration:
```c#
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddLogging(logging => logging.AddConsole())
    .AddTransient<MyClass>() // Add this line
    .BuildServiceProvider();
```
This registers `MyClass` as a service and allows the `ILogger` dependency to be resolved when it is injected into the constructor.
