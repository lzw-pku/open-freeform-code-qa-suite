It seems that there might be a dependency conflict between the version of Hibernate Validator that is included in your project and the one that is included in your JBoss server. 

You can try excluding the Hibernate Validator dependency from your project and let JBoss provide its own version. To do this, add the following exclusion to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

Then, make sure that your JBoss server includes a compatible version of Hibernate Validator. You can check the version of Hibernate Validator that is included in your JBoss server by looking at the server logs when it starts up.

If this doesn't solve the issue, you can try upgrading the version of Hibernate Validator in your project to match the one in your JBoss server. You can do this by adding the following dependency to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.5.Final-redhat-2</version>
</dependency>
```

Make sure to replace the version number with the one that matches the version of Hibernate Validator in your JBoss server.
