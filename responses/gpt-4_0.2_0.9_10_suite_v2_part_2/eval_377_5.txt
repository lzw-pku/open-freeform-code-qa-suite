The issue you're facing might be due to the IntelliJ IDEA version you're using. IntelliJ IDEA 2017 doesn't fully support Java 11. You should upgrade your IntelliJ IDEA to 2018.2 or later versions, which have full support for Java 11.

After upgrading IntelliJ, you can set the project SDK by following these steps:

1. Go to `File > Project Structure > Project`.
2. In the `Project SDK` section, select the JDK 11 you installed.
3. In the `Project language level` section, select `11 - Local variable syntax for lambda parameters`.
4. Click `OK`.

Also, Java 11 doesn't have a separate JRE folder like previous versions. The `jre` folder is not included in JDK since Java 9. So, it's normal to see only the JDK folder for `11.0.1`.
