The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations`. It is part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

You need to add a reference to the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace to your file. You can do this by adding the following line at the top of your file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

If you still can't access the `[Keyless]` attribute, make sure you have installed the correct version of Entity Framework Core. The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in EF Core 5.0. If you're using an older version, you won't have access to this attribute. 

To update your EF Core version, you can use the following command in the NuGet Package Manager Console:

```shell
Update-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -Version 5.0.0
```

After updating, you should be able to use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your models.
