The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Spring Boot does not support XML responses out of the box. You need to add the necessary dependencies to your `build.gradle` file to enable XML support.

Add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-xml'
```

This will add the Jackson XML data format library to your project, which Spring Boot can use to automatically convert your responses to XML when the `Accept: application/xml` header is present in the request.

After adding this dependency, rebuild your project and try your curl command again. The server should now be able to respond with XML.
