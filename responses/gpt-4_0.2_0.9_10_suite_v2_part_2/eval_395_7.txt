You can't directly inject a generic interface, but you can inject a concrete class that implements the generic interface. Here is an example:

```c#
public class DatabaseService<T> : IDatabaseService<T>
{
    public IEnumerable<T> GetList()
    {
        // Implementation here
    }
    ...
}
```

Then in your `Startup.cs`, you can inject it like this:

```c#
services.AddScoped(typeof(IDatabaseService<>), typeof(DatabaseService<>));
```

This will allow you to inject `IDatabaseService<T>` into your controllers, where `T` is the type you want to use.
