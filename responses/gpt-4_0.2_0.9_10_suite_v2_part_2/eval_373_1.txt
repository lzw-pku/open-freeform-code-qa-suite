It seems like you are facing a version conflict between Hibernate Validator versions. The `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` annotations are part of Hibernate Validator 6.x, but your logs show that Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2 is being used, which does not support these annotations.

Spring Boot 2.x should come with Hibernate Validator 6.x by default. However, it seems like JBoss is providing its own version of Hibernate Validator (5.3.5.Final-redhat-2), which is being used instead of the one provided by Spring Boot.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Exclude the Hibernate Validator provided by JBoss. This can be done by creating a `jboss-deployment-structure.xml` file in your `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF` directory with the following content:

```xml
<jboss-deployment-structure>
    <deployment>
        <exclusions>
            <module name="org.hibernate.validator" />
        </exclusions>
    </deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>
```

2. Add the Hibernate Validator dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

3. Ensure that your application is using the correct version of Hibernate Validator. You can do this by adding the following code to your application:

```java
System.out.println(Validation.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
```

This will print the location of the `Validation` class, which is part of Hibernate Validator. The printed location should point to the Hibernate Validator jar file in your `.m2` directory, not to a jar file inside JBoss.

Please note that these steps are specific to JBoss. If you are using a different application server, the steps might be different.
