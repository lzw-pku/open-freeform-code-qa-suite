The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It is part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace.

To use the `[Keyless]` attribute, you need to install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational` package and add the following using directive at the top of your file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

Then you can use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class like this:

```csharp
[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    // ...
}
```

Please make sure you have the correct version of Entity Framework Core installed that supports the `[Keyless]` attribute. It was introduced in EF Core 5.0. If you are using an older version, you might need to upgrade.
