This error is due to a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the Maven version (3.8.5) that comes with Spring Boot 2.7. IntelliJ IDEA does not yet fully support this version of Maven.

To resolve this issue, you can downgrade the Maven version to 3.8.4 or earlier, which is compatible with IntelliJ IDEA. 

You can change the Maven version in the `pom.xml` file of your project:

```xml
<properties>
    <maven.version>3.8.4</maven.version>
</properties>
```

Or, you can configure IntelliJ IDEA to use a different Maven installation:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Go to `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven`.
3. Under `Maven home directory`, select the directory of the Maven version you want to use.

Remember to restart IntelliJ IDEA after making these changes.
