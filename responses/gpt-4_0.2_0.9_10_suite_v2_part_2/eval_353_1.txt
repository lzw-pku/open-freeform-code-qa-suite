The error message `Unrecognized option: --add-opens` suggests that the Java version you're using does not recognize the `--add-opens` option. This option is used to relax the strong encapsulation of Java module system, and it's available from Java 9 onwards.

Hyperledger Besu requires Java 11 or later to run. You are currently using Java 8 as indicated by your `java -version` output. This is the reason why you're getting the error.

To fix this issue, you need to install Java 11 or a later version. Here are the steps:

1. Download the appropriate JDK for your operating system from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK website](https://jdk.java.net/11/).

2. Install the JDK by following the instructions provided by the installer.

3. After installation, open a new terminal window and verify the Java version by running `java -version`. The output should indicate that you're running Java 11 or later.

4. Now try running the `bin\besu --help` command again. It should work without any errors.

If you still encounter issues, make sure that the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the location of your JDK 11 installation, and that the JDK bin directory is added to your PATH environment variable.
