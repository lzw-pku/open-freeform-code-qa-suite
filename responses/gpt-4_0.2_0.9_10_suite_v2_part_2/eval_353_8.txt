The error message `Unrecognized option: --add-opens` indicates that the Java version you're using does not recognize the `--add-opens` option. This option is used to relax the strong encapsulation of Java module system introduced in Java 9. 

Hyperledger Besu requires Java 11 or later to run. Your current Java version is 1.8.0_241, which is Java 8. This is why you're getting the error.

To solve this issue, you need to install Java 11 or a later version. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Download the appropriate JDK for your operating system from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK website](https://jdk.java.net/11/).

2. Install the JDK by following the instructions provided by the installer.

3. After installation, open a new command prompt and verify the Java version by running the command `java -version`. It should display a version number that is 11 or later.

4. If the version is not updated or the old version is still showing, you may need to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the new JDK installation directory and add it to your system path. You can follow the instructions in this [guide](https://www.baeldung.com/java-home-on-windows-7-8-10-mac-os-x-linux) to do this.

5. Once the Java version is updated, try running the `bin\besu --help` command again. It should work without any errors.
