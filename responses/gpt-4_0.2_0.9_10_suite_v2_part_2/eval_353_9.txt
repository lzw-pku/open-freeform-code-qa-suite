The error message `Unrecognized option: --add-opens` indicates that the `--add-opens` option is not recognized by your Java version. This option is used to relax the strong encapsulation of Java module for the specified package to the specified module, or to all unnamed modules if `ALL-UNNAMED` is used. It's available in Java 9 and later versions.

The version of Java you're using, as indicated by `java version "1.8.0_241"`, is Java 8. This version does not recognize the `--add-opens` option, hence the error.

Hyperledger Besu requires Java 11 or later to run. You can download Java 11 from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use an open-source version like [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/11/).

After installing Java 11 or later, you should be able to run Hyperledger Besu without encountering the `Unrecognized option: --add-opens` error. Make sure that your system is using the correct Java version by running `java -version` again. If it still shows Java 8, you may need to update your `PATH` environment variable or set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to your Java 11 installation.
