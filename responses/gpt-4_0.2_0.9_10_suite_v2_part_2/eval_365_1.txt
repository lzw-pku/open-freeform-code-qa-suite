The Maven Wrapper is a shell script used to automatically manage the correct version of Maven for your project. It's a good practice to use it because it ensures that everyone working on the project uses the same version of Maven.

The Maven Wrapper uses the JAVA_HOME environment variable to determine which Java version to use. If you want to use a different Java version, you can change the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the desired Java installation directory.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Find out where your desired Java version is installed. You can do this by running the command `which java` in your terminal. This will print the path to the Java executable. The Java installation directory is the directory containing the directory containing the Java executable. For example, if `which java` prints `/usr/bin/java`, your Java installation directory is `/usr`.

2. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the Java installation directory. You can do this by adding the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file (or the equivalent for your shell), replacing `/path/to/java` with your Java installation directory:

    ```bash
    export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java
    ```

    Then, run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile` (or the equivalent for your shell) to apply the changes.

3. Now, when you run the Maven Wrapper, it should use the Java version you specified.

If you want to use a different Java version only for a specific project, you can set the JAVA_HOME environment variable in a shell script that you run before running the Maven Wrapper. Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java
./mvnw clean install
```

This script sets the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the desired Java installation directory, then runs the Maven Wrapper. The JAVA_HOME environment variable is only changed for the duration of this script, so it won't affect other terminal sessions or scripts.
