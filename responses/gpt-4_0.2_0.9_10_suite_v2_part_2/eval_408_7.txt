The error is because you are trying to create an index on a navigation property `Gender`. EF Core does not support this. You should create an index on the foreign key `GenderId` instead.

Here is how you should modify your `OnModelCreating` method:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In the above code, I replaced `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` with `user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);`. Now you are creating an index on the `GenderId` column, which is the foreign key column. This should solve your problem.
