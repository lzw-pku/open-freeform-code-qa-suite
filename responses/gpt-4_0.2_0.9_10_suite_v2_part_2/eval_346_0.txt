This error is due to a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and Maven 3.8.5, which is used in Spring Boot 2.7. IntelliJ IDEA does not yet fully support Maven 3.8.5.

To resolve this issue, you can downgrade the Maven version to 3.8.4 or earlier. You can do this by modifying the `pom.xml` file in your project and setting the Maven version to 3.8.4.

If you want to use Maven 3.8.5, you will need to wait for an update from IntelliJ IDEA that adds support for this version.
