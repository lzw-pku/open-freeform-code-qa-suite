The problem is that you're trying to create an index on a navigation property (`Gender`). EF Core does not support this. 

Indexes in Entity Framework Core are used to speed up the retrieval of data from the database and they can only be applied to scalar properties (like `int`, `string`, `DateTime`, etc.), not navigation properties.

If you want to create an index on `GenderId`, you can do it like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

This will create an index on the `GenderId` column in the `User` table, which should speed up queries that filter or sort on `GenderId`.
