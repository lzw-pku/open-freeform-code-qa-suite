The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations`. It's part of `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

This attribute is used to denote that an entity does not have a key and should never be tracked for changes in the DbContext. It is typically used for read-only entities that are the result of certain types of queries.

To use it, you need to add a reference to the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

Here is an example of how to use it:

```c#
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
    // other properties...
}
```

And then you can use it in your `DbContext`:

```c#
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```

Make sure you have installed the appropriate Entity Framework Core package. If you're using .NET Core 3.x, the package is `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`, and for .NET 5.0 and later, the package is `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational`.
