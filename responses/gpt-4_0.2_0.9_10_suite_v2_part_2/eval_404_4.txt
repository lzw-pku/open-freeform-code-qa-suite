You don't need to wrap your response with `Json()`. The `Ok()` method will automatically format your response as JSON. Here's how you can modify your code:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return Ok("123");
}
```

This will return a HTTP 200 status code with the body containing the string "123".

If you want to return a different HTTP status code, you can use the `StatusCode()` method, like this:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return StatusCode(201, "123");
}
```

This will return a HTTP 201 status code with the body containing the string "123".

If you want to return a complex object as JSON, you can just pass the object to `Ok()` or `StatusCode()`, like this:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    var data = new { Name = "John", Age = 30 };
    return Ok(data);
}
```

This will return a HTTP 200 status code with the body containing the JSON representation of the `data` object.
