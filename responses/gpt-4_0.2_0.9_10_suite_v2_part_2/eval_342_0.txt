The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Spring Boot's default configuration for HTTP message converters includes support for JSON out of the box, but not for XML.

To enable XML support, you need to add the Jackson XML dataformat dependency to your project:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // ...
    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-xml'
    // ...
}
```

After adding this dependency, Spring Boot should automatically configure an `HttpMessageConverter` that can handle XML, and your API should start supporting XML responses.
