The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property. In Entity Framework, indexes can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties.

In your case, you are trying to create an index on the `Gender` property, which is a navigation property. If you want to create an index on the `GenderId` property, you should do it like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

This will create an index on the `GenderId` property, which is a foreign key to the `Gender` table. This can improve the performance of queries that filter or sort by the `GenderId` property.
