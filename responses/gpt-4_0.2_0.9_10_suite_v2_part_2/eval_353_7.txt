The error message you're seeing is due to the `--add-opens` option, which is not recognized by your Java version. This option is used to relax the strong encapsulation of Java module system introduced in Java 9. 

However, you're using Java 8 (`java version "1.8.0_241"`), which doesn't support this option. 

Hyperledger Besu requires Java 11 or later to run. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK which can be downloaded from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

After installing Java 11 or later, you should set it as your default Java version. You can do this by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to your Java 11 installation directory and adding it to your `PATH`. 

Here is how you can do it on Windows:

1. Right-click on 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'.
2. Click on 'Advanced System Settings'.
3. Click on 'Environment Variables'.
4. Click on 'New' under 'System variables'.
5. Enter `JAVA_HOME` as the variable name.
6. Enter the path to your Java 11 installation directory as the variable value (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1`).
7. Click 'OK'.
8. In the 'System variables' section, find the 'Path' variable, select it and click 'Edit'.
9. In the 'Variable value' field, add the path to the Java 11 'bin' directory. Make sure to separate this value from existing values with a semicolon. For example, if the path to the 'bin' directory is `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1\bin`, you would add `;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1\bin` to the end of the 'Variable value' field.
10. Click 'OK' three times to close all dialog boxes.

After doing this, you should be able to run Hyperledger Besu without encountering the `Unrecognized option: --add-opens` error.
