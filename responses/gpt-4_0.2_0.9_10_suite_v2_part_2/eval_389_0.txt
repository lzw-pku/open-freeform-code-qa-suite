The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It's part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

You need to install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational` package to your project to use it. You can do this via NuGet package manager in Visual Studio or by running the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```shell
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational
```

After installing the package, you should be able to use the `[Keyless]` attribute by adding the following using directive to your file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

Then you can use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class like this:

```csharp
[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
    // other properties...
}
```

This will tell Entity Framework Core that your `MyKeylessClass` does not have a primary key.
