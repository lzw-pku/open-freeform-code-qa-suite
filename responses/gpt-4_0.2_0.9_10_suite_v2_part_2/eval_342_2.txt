The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Spring Boot does not support XML responses by default. It primarily supports JSON responses out of the box.

To enable XML responses, you need to add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-xml'
```

This dependency includes the Jackson XML data format module, which allows your application to serialize and deserialize XML.

After adding this dependency, Spring Boot should be able to handle XML responses. If you still encounter issues, you may need to configure your `HttpMessageConverter` to use the `MappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter`.
