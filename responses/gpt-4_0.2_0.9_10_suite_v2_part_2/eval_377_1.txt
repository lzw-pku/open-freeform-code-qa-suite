Your installation of JDK 11 seems correct. The issue is likely with IntelliJ IDEA 2017. It does not fully support Java 11. 

Java 11 support was added in IntelliJ IDEA 2018.2. So, you should upgrade your IntelliJ IDEA to a version that supports Java 11 (2018.2 or later).

After upgrading IntelliJ, you should be able to add JDK 11 in `File > Project Structure > SDKs` and set it as the project SDK. Also, ensure that the `Language Level` in `Project Settings > Project` is set to 11.
