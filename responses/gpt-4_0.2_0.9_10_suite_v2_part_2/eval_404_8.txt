In your code, you are wrapping the JSON result inside an Ok result. This is unnecessary as the Ok method already returns a status code of 200 and formats the response as JSON. 

You should return your data directly from the Ok method like this:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return Ok("123");
}
```

This will return a response with a status code of 200 and a body of "123". 

If you want to return a JSON object, you can do it like this:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return Ok(new { value = "123" });
}
```

This will return a response with a status code of 200 and a body of `{"value":"123"}`.

If you want to return a different status code, you can use the `StatusCode` method:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return StatusCode(201, new { value = "123" });
}
```

This will return a response with a status code of 201 and a body of `{"value":"123"}`.
