The issue is likely due to the Gradle version you're using. Java 17 is supported starting from Gradle 7.3. 

You can check your Gradle version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./gradlew --version
```

If your Gradle version is less than 7.3, you need to upgrade it. You can do this by changing the version in your `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file:

```properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.3-bin.zip
```

After updating the Gradle version, try to run your application again.
