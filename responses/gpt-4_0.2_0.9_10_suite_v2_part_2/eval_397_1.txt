The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property. In Entity Framework Core, indexes can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties.

You can create an index on the `GenderId` property instead, which is the foreign key property for the `Gender` navigation property. Here's how you can do it:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, `user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);` creates an index on the `GenderId` column in the `User` table. This can help to speed up queries that filter or sort by `GenderId`.
