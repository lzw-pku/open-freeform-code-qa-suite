The `[Keyless]` attribute is part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace, not the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. 

You should add a reference to the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` in your class file to use the `[Keyless]` attribute.

Here is how you can do it:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
    // other properties...
}
```

Also, ensure that you have installed the appropriate version of Entity Framework Core. The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in EF Core 5.0. If you're using an older version, you won't have access to this attribute. You can check your EF Core version in your project's `.csproj` file. If you're using an older version, consider upgrading to the latest stable version.
