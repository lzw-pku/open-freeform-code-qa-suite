The issue you're facing might be due to the version of IntelliJ IDEA you're using. IntelliJ IDEA 2017.x versions have partial support for Java 9 and don't support Java 11.

Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Upgrade your IntelliJ IDEA to the latest version (2021.x or later). You can download it from the [official JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

2. After upgrading, go to `File > Project Structure > Project Settings > Project` and set the `Project SDK` to `11 (java version "11.0.1")`.

3. Then, go to `File > Project Structure > Project Settings > Modules`, select your module, and set the `Module SDK` to `11 (java version "11.0.1")`.

4. Finally, go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler` and set the `Target bytecode version` to `11` for your module.

After these changes, your project should compile and run with Java 11.
