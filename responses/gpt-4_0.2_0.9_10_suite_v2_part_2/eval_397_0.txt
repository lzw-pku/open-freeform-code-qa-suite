The error is happening because you are trying to create an index on a navigation property `Gender`. EF Core does not support this.

Indexes in Entity Framework Core are used to speed up the retrieval of data from the database and they can only be applied to scalar properties, not navigation properties.

You should create the index on the `GenderId` property instead, which is the foreign key property. Here is the corrected code:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

Now, when you run the `dotnet ef add migration User` command, it should work without any errors.
