The error message you're seeing is because Spring Cloud 2020.0.2 (part of Spring Cloud Config 3.0.2) is trying to connect to a Config Server, but it can't find the `spring.config.import` property to know where to connect.

Since you're not using Config Server, you can disable it by setting the `spring.cloud.config.enabled` property to `false`.

You can add this property to your `@SpringBootTest` annotation like so:

```java
@SpringBootTest(
    webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT,
    classes = {
        ProductCompositeServiceApplication.class,
        TestSecurityConfig.class },
    properties = {
        "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true",
        "spring.cloud.config.enabled=false" })
```

This should prevent Spring Cloud Config from trying to connect to a Config Server and resolve the error.
