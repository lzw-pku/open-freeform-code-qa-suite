The error you're encountering is likely due to the Gradle version you're using. Gradle versions prior to 7.0 do not support Java 17. 

To resolve this issue, you need to upgrade your Gradle version to 7.0 or later. You can do this by updating your `gradle-wrapper.properties` file:

```properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.3.1-bin.zip
```

After updating the Gradle version, re-import the Gradle project in IntelliJ IDEA to apply the changes. 

If you're using the Gradle wrapper, you might also need to update it using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 7.3.1
```

This command will update the Gradle wrapper to use the specified version.
