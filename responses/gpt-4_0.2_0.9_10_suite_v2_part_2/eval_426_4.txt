You can use the `now()` function provided by Laravel to get the current date and time. Here's how you can modify your function to use the current date and time:

```php
function insert(Request $req)
{
    $name = $req->input('name');
    $address = $req->input('address');
    $data = array("name" => $name, "address" => $address, "created_at" => now(), "updated_at" => now());
    DB::table('student')->insert($data);
    echo "Record inserted successfully.<br/>";
    return redirect('/');
}
```

The `now()` function will return the current date and time in a format that MySQL can understand for a datetime field.

However, if you are using Laravel's Eloquent ORM and have a model for your 'student' table, Laravel will automatically handle the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields for you. You just need to ensure that these fields are not in the `$guarded` array of your model.
