This error is due to a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the Maven version (3.8.5) that comes with Spring Boot 2.7. IntelliJ IDEA may not yet fully support this Maven version.

Here are a few potential solutions:

1. **Downgrade Maven version**: You can manually change the Maven version in the `pom.xml` file to a version that is compatible with your IntelliJ IDEA version. For example, you can change it to 3.8.4 or lower.

2. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**: Make sure your IntelliJ IDEA is up-to-date. JetBrains regularly releases updates to IntelliJ IDEA that often include fixes for compatibility issues with newer versions of Maven.

3. **Use IntelliJ IDEA's bundled Maven**: IntelliJ IDEA comes with a bundled version of Maven that is guaranteed to be compatible. You can switch to using this version by going to `Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven -> Maven home directory` and selecting the bundled version.

Remember to re-import the project after making these changes.
