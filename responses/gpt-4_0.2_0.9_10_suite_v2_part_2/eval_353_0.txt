The error message you're seeing is related to the Java version you're using. The `--add-opens` option is not recognized because it was introduced in Java 9, and you're using Java 8.

Hyperledger Besu requires Java 11 or later to run. You can check the [system requirements](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Get-Started/System-Requirements/) in the official documentation.

Here are the steps to resolve your issue:

1. Uninstall your current Java version.
2. Install Java 11 or later. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.
3. Verify the installation by running `java -version` in your command prompt. It should display the correct version number.
4. Try running `bin\besu --help` again.

If you still encounter issues, make sure that your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to the correct Java installation directory.
