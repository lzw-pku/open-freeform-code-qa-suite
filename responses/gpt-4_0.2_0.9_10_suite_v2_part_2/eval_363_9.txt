The error you're seeing is because Spring Cloud 2020.0.2 (aka Ilford) is designed to work with Spring Boot 2.4.x, which introduces a new way of handling configuration files and imports. 

The `spring.config.import` property is a new feature in Spring Boot 2.4.x that allows you to import configuration from another source. The error message is indicating that Spring Cloud Config is expecting this property to be set, but it's not.

However, since you mentioned that your project is not a ConfigServer and doesn't use ConfigServer, you should not need to set this property. The fact that you're seeing this error might be due to a misconfiguration or an issue with the Spring Cloud version you're using.

To fix this issue, you can try the following:

1. Exclude `spring-cloud-starter-config` from your dependencies if you're not using it. This should prevent Spring Cloud Config from being included in your project and causing this error:

```groovy
configurations {
    all {
        exclude group: 'org.springframework.cloud', module: 'spring-cloud-starter-config'
    }
}
```

2. If you're using Spring Cloud Config, make sure you're using the correct version that is compatible with Spring Boot 2.4.x and Spring Cloud 2020.0.2.

3. If you're using Spring Cloud Config, you might need to set the `spring.config.import` property to the location of your Config Server:

```properties
spring.config.import=configserver:http://localhost:8888
```

4. If none of the above work, you might want to consider downgrading to Spring Cloud 2020.0.1 or upgrading to a later version, if available, as there might be a bug or issue with the specific version you're using.
