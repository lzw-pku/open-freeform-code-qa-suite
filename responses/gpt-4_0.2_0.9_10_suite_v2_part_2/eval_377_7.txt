The issue you're facing is likely due to the fact that IntelliJ IDEA 2017.3 and earlier versions do not support JDK 11. JDK 11 support was added in IntelliJ IDEA 2018.2. 

Here are the steps you can take to resolve this:

1. Upgrade your IntelliJ IDEA to a version that supports JDK 11 (2018.2 or later).
2. After upgrading, go to `File > Project Structure > Project`.
3. In the `Project SDK` section, select the JDK 11 that you installed.
4. In the `Project language level` section, select `11 - Local variable syntax for lambda parameters`.
5. Click `OK` to save the changes.

As for the JDK and JRE folders, starting from Java 9, Oracle provides JDK distributions only. The JRE is essentially a subset of the JDK and since Java 9, Oracle has encouraged developers to use the JDK instead of the JRE for running applications. That's why you only see a JDK folder for Java 11.
