The error you're encountering is because Gradle is not using the correct Java version. You need to make sure that Gradle uses the same Java version as your project.

You can do this by specifying the Java version in the `gradle.properties` file. If the file does not exist, create it in the root directory of your project.

Add the following lines to your `gradle.properties` file:

```properties
org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk17
```

Replace `/path/to/your/jdk17` with the actual path to your JDK 17 installation.

You can find the path to your JDK 17 installation in IntelliJ IDEA by going to `File -> Project Structure -> SDKs`.

After you've done this, try to rebuild your project. If the problem persists, you might need to restart IntelliJ IDEA.
