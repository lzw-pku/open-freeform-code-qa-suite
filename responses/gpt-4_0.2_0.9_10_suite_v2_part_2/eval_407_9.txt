In a .NET 6 console application, you don't have the `WebApplication` class available. Instead, you can use the `ConfigurationBuilder` to read the `appsettings.json` file. Here's an example:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
    .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true);

IConfiguration configuration = builder.Build();

// Now you can access your settings.
string mySetting = configuration["MySetting"];
```

Don't forget to add the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json` NuGet package to your project, and make sure your `appsettings.json` file is set to copy to the output directory.

Also, you need to import `System.IO` namespace to use `Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()`.
