Sure, here is a simple function in Go that converts an ASCII code to a string:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func getASCIIAsString(asciiCode uint64) {
	asciiString := string(asciiCode)
	fmt.Println(asciiString)
}

func main() {
	A := uint64('A')
	getASCIIAsString(A)
}
```

In this function, we use the `string()` function to convert the ASCII code to a string. The `fmt.Println()` function is then used to print the resulting string.

Please note that ASCII codes are usually represented as integers in the range 0-127, so this function may not behave as expected if you pass in a number outside of this range.
