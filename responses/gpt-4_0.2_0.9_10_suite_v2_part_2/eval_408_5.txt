The error is because you are trying to create an index on a navigation property `Gender`. Entity Framework does not support indexes on navigation properties. 

Indexes in Entity Framework are used to speed up the performance of data retrieval operations on a database. They are only applicable to scalar properties (like `int`, `string`, `DateTime`, etc.), not navigation properties.

You should create an index on the foreign key `GenderId` instead. Here is how you can do it:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In the above code, I replaced `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` with `user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);`. Now, the index will be created on the `GenderId` column in the `User` table.
