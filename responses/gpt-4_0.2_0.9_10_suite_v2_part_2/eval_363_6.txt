The error message you're seeing is due to a change in Spring Cloud 2020.0.2. The `spring.config.import` property is now required for Config Server clients. However, since your application is not a Config Server client, you're seeing this error.

The `spring.config.import` property is used to import configuration data from Config Server. If you're not using Config Server, you can set this property to `optional:configserver:` to avoid the error.

However, since you're not using Config Server, you should remove the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency from your `build.gradle` file. This dependency is used for Config Server clients, and it's likely causing the error you're seeing.

Here's how you can modify your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // Remove this line
    // implementation('org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-config')

    // Other dependencies...
}
```

After making this change, try rebuilding your project. If you're still seeing the error, you can try setting the `spring.config.import` property to `optional:configserver:` in your test class:

```java
@SpringBootTest(
    webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT,
    classes = {
        ProductCompositeServiceApplication.class,
        TestSecurityConfig.class },
    properties = {
        "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true",
        "spring.config.import=optional:configserver:" })
```

This tells Spring Boot to try to import configuration data from Config Server, but to continue if it can't. Since your application isn't a Config Server client, this should prevent the error from occurring.
