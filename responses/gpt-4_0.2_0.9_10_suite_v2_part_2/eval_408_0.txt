The error is occurring because you are trying to create an index on a navigation property, which is not allowed. 

Indexes in Entity Framework are used to speed up the performance of data retrieval operations on a database. They are only applicable to scalar properties, not navigation properties.

So, you should remove the line `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` from your `OnModelCreating` method.

Here is the corrected code:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

If you want to create an index on the `GenderId` property, you can do so like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```
This will create an index on the `GenderId` column in the `User` table, which can speed up queries that filter or sort by `GenderId`.
