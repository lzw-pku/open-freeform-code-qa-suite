The error message indicates that the Spring Cloud Config Client is active in your application, but it can't find the `spring.config.import` property to know where the Config Server is located.

Even though you mentioned that you have commented out the Config Client, it seems like it's still active. This might be because of the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency in your `build.gradle` file. This starter brings in the Config Client, which is active by default.

If you don't use Spring Cloud Config at all, you can remove the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency from your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // Remove this line
    // implementation('org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-config')
}
```

If you need the Config Client for some parts of your application but not for others, you can disable it for specific tests using the `spring.cloud.config.enabled` property:

```java
@SpringBootTest(
    webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT,
    classes = {
        ProductCompositeServiceApplication.class,
        TestSecurityConfig.class },
    properties = {
        "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true",
        "spring.cloud.config.enabled=false" })
```

This will disable the Config Client for this specific test, and you should no longer see the error message about the missing `spring.config.import` property.
