The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property. In Entity Framework, an index can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties.

In your case, you are trying to create an index on the `Gender` navigation property of the `User` entity, which is not allowed. 

If you want to create an index on the `GenderId` property, you can do so like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

This will create an index on the `GenderId` property of the `User` entity, which should be what you want.
