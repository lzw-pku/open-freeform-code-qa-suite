In a .NET 6 console application, you don't have the `WebApplication` class available. You can use the `ConfigurationBuilder` class to read the `appsettings.json` file.

Here is an example:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using System.IO;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
            .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
            .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true);

        IConfigurationRoot configuration = builder.Build();

        // Now you can read settings from the configuration object
        var settingValue = configuration["MySetting"];
    }
}
```

In this example, `appsettings.json` should be in the same directory as your executable. If it's not, you should adjust the `SetBasePath` method accordingly.

Also, make sure that the `appsettings.json` file is being copied to the output directory. You can set this in the file properties in Visual Studio, or by editing the .csproj file and adding:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <None Update="appsettings.json">
    <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
  </None>
</ItemGroup>
```

This will ensure that the `appsettings.json` file is copied to the output directory every time you build your application.
