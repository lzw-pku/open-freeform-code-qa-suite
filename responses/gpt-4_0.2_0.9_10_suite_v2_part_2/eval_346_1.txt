This error is caused by a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the Maven version (3.8.5) that comes with Spring Boot 2.7. IntelliJ IDEA may not yet fully support this Maven version.

Here are a few solutions you can try:

1. **Downgrade Maven version**: You can manually change the Maven version in your project to a lower version that is compatible with your IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by modifying the `pom.xml` file or changing the Maven settings in your IDE.

2. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**: JetBrains regularly releases updates to IntelliJ IDEA that include fixes and improvements. Check if there's an update available for your IntelliJ IDEA and install it. The latest versions usually have better support for newer tools and technologies.

3. **Use IntelliJ IDEA's bundled Maven**: IntelliJ IDEA comes with a bundled Maven that is guaranteed to be compatible. You can switch to use this bundled Maven in the settings: `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven -> Maven home directory`.

Remember to re-import your project after making these changes.
