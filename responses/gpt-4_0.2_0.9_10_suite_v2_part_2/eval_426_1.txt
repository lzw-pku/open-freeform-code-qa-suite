You can use the `now()` function provided by Laravel to get the current date and time. Here's how you can modify your function:

```php
function insert(Request $req)
{
    $name = $req->input('name');
    $address = $req->input('address');
    $data = array("name" => $name, "address" => $address, "created_at" => now(), "updated_at" => now());
    DB::table('student')->insert($data);
    echo "Record inserted successfully.<br/>";
    return redirect('/');
}
```

The `now()` function will return the current date and time in the format required by MySQL. 

However, if you're using Laravel's Eloquent ORM to manage your database, you don't need to manually set the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields. Laravel will automatically set these fields for you when you create or update a model.
