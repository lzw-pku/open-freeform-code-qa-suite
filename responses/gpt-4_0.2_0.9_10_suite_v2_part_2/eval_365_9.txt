The Java version used by Maven can be controlled by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. If you're using the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw` or `mvnw.cmd`), it will use the Java version specified by `JAVA_HOME`.

Here's how you can set `JAVA_HOME`:

**On Windows:**

1. Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start Menu.
2. Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
3. Click on "Environment Variables...".
4. Under "System variables", click on "New...".
5. For "Variable name", enter `JAVA_HOME`.
6. For "Variable value", enter the path to your JDK installation (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_231`).
7. Click "OK" on all dialogs to apply the changes.

**On Unix-based systems (like Linux or Mac):**

1. Open a terminal.
2. Add the following line to your `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc` file (replace `/path/to/jdk` with the actual path to your JDK installation):

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk
```

3. Apply the changes by running `source ~/.bashrc`, `source ~/.bash_profile`, or `source ~/.zshrc`.

After setting `JAVA_HOME`, the Maven Wrapper should use the correct Java version. If it's still not working, make sure the `JAVA_HOME` variable is correctly set by running `echo $JAVA_HOME` (Unix) or `echo %JAVA_HOME%` (Windows) in a terminal/command prompt.
