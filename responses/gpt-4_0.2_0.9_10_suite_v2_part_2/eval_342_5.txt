The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Spring Boot doesn't support XML responses by default. It primarily supports JSON responses out of the box.

To enable XML responses, you need to add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-xml'
```

This will add Jackson's dataformat XML module to your project, which Spring Boot can use to automatically configure XML responses.

After adding this dependency, you should be able to get XML responses from your API.
