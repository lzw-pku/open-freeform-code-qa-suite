The error you're encountering is due to a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the version of Maven used in your project. 

As of now, IntelliJ IDEA supports up to Maven 3.8.1. If you're using a newer version (like 3.8.5 in your case), you might encounter this error.

To resolve this issue, you can downgrade the Maven version in your project to 3.8.1 or earlier. You can do this by modifying the `maven-wrapper.properties` file in your project:

```properties
distributionUrl=https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/3.8.1/apache-maven-3.8.1-bin.zip
```

Alternatively, you can wait for JetBrains to release an update for IntelliJ IDEA that supports the newer Maven versions.
