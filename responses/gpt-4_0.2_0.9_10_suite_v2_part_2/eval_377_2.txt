The issue you're facing is likely due to the IntelliJ IDEA version you're using. IntelliJ IDEA 2017 does not fully support Java 11. You will need to upgrade your IntelliJ IDEA to at least version 2018.2.x to get full support for Java 11.

As for the JDK 11 installation, it's correct that you only see a JDK folder and not a JRE one. Since Java 9, the JRE is no longer provided as a separate module and is included in the JDK.

So, to resolve your issue, please upgrade your IntelliJ IDEA to a version that fully supports Java 11.
