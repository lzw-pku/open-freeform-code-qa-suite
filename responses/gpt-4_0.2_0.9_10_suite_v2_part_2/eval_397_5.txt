The error is because you are trying to create an index on a navigation property `Gender`. EF Core does not support this. You should create an index on `GenderId` instead, which is the foreign key property. 

Here is how you can do it:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

Now, when you run `dotnet ef add migration User`, it should work without any errors.
