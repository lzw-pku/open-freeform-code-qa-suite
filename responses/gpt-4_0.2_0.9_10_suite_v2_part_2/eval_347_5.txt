The error you're encountering is because Gradle is not using the correct Java version. You need to ensure that Gradle uses the same Java version as your IntelliJ IDEA project.

You can specify which Java version Gradle should use in the `gradle.properties` file. If the file doesn't exist, create it in the root directory of your project.

Add the following line to the `gradle.properties` file:

```properties
org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk17
```

Replace `/path/to/your/jdk17` with the actual path to your JDK 17 installation.

If you don't know the path to your JDK 17, you can find it in IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Go to `File -> Project Structure -> SDKs`.
2. Select your JDK 17 from the list on the left.
3. The `JDK home path` at the top is the path you need.

After setting the JDK path for Gradle, try running your application again. It should now work as expected.
