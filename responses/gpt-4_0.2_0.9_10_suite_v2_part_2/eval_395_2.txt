You can't directly register a generic interface without specifying the type. You need to register each type you want to use with the interface. For example, if you have a `User` class and you want to use `IDatabaseService<User>`, you would register it like this:

```c#
services.AddScoped<IDatabaseService<User>, DatabaseService<User>>();
```

In this example, `DatabaseService<User>` is the concrete implementation of `IDatabaseService<User>`. You would need to do this for each type you want to use with `IDatabaseService<T>`.
