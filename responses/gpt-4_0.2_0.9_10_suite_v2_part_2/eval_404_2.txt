Your current code is returning an `OkObjectResult` that wraps a `JsonResult` which is not necessary. The `Ok()` method already returns a status code of 200 and formats the response as JSON by default.

You can simply return the value you want to serialize to JSON:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return Ok("123");
}
```

This will return a response with a 200 OK status code and a body of `"123"`.

If you want to return a different status code, you can use the `StatusCode()` method:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return StatusCode(201, "123");
}
```

This will return a response with a 201 status code and a body of `"123"`.

If you want to return a complex object as JSON, you can do so:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    var data = new { Name = "John", Age = 30 };
    return Ok(data);
}
```

This will return a response with a 200 OK status code and a body of `{"Name":"John","Age":30}`.
