The error message `Unrecognized option: --add-opens` indicates that the Java version you're using doesn't recognize the `--add-opens` option. This option is used to relax the strong encapsulation of Java module system. It's available in Java 9 and later versions.

Hyperledger Besu requires Java 11 or later to run. The Java version you're using is 1.8, which is not compatible with Hyperledger Besu. That's why you're getting this error.

To solve this issue, you need to install Java 11 or a later version. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Download the Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK website](https://jdk.java.net/).

2. Install the JDK by following the instructions provided by Oracle or OpenJDK.

3. After installation, open a new terminal window and check the Java version by running the following command:

```shell
java -version
```

The output should indicate that you're using Java 11 or a later version.

4. Now, you should be able to run Hyperledger Besu without encountering the `Unrecognized option: --add-opens` error.
