The issue you're experiencing is likely due to a version mismatch between the Hibernate Validator and the Bean Validation API. 

The `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` annotations are part of the Bean Validation 2.0 specification, which is implemented by Hibernate Validator 6.0. However, the version of Hibernate Validator that you're using (5.3.5.Final-redhat-2) only supports the Bean Validation 1.1 specification, which does not include these annotations.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that you're using a version of Hibernate Validator that supports the Bean Validation 2.0 specification. You can do this by adding an explicit dependency on Hibernate Validator 6.0 (or later) in your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

You also need to ensure that you're using the correct version of the Bean Validation API:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.validation</groupId>
    <artifactId>validation-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.1.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

Please note that Spring Boot 2.0.4.RELEASE comes with Hibernate Validator 6.0.11.Final by default, so if you're still seeing the old version, it might be because another dependency is pulling it in. You can use the Maven Dependency Plugin to analyze your project's dependencies and find out where the old version is coming from:

```bash
mvn dependency:tree
```

This command will print a tree of all your project's dependencies, which you can then search for `hibernate-validator` to see where the old version is coming from.
