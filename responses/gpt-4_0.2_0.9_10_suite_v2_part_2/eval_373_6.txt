It seems like you're facing a version conflict issue. The `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` annotations are part of Hibernate Validator 6.x, but your logs show that Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2 is being used at runtime. 

Spring Boot 2.0.4.RELEASE relies on Hibernate Validator 6.0.11.Final, which should support `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank`. However, it seems like JBoss is using its own bundled version of Hibernate Validator (5.3.5.Final-redhat-2) instead of the one provided by Spring Boot.

To resolve this issue, you can try to exclude the Hibernate Validator module in JBoss. You can do this by creating a `jboss-deployment-structure.xml` file in your `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/` directory with the following content:

```xml
<jboss-deployment-structure>
    <deployment>
        <exclusions>
            <module name="org.hibernate.validator" />
        </exclusions>
    </deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>
```

This tells JBoss to exclude its own Hibernate Validator module, and it should then use the one provided by your application (Hibernate Validator 6.0.11.Final).

If this doesn't work, another option is to downgrade your code to use Hibernate Validator 5.x compatible annotations. In this case, you would use `@NotNull` and `@Size(min=1)` to achieve the same result as `@NotEmpty` or `@NotBlank`.
