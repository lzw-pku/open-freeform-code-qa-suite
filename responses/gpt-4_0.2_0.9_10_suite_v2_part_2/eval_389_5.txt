The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations`. It's actually part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

You need to make sure that you have the correct Entity Framework Core package installed. The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in EF Core 5.0. If you're using an older version, you won't have access to this attribute.

To install or upgrade to the latest version of Entity Framework Core, you can use the following command in your Package Manager Console:

```shell
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -Version 5.0.0
```

After installing or upgrading, you should be able to use the `[Keyless]` attribute by adding the following using directive at the top of your file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

Then you can use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class:

```csharp
[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
    // other properties...
}
```

And in your `DbContext`:

```csharp
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```

Now you should be able to use `_context.KeylessModel.FromSqlRaw(...)` without having to add a primary key to your `MyKeylessClass` model.
