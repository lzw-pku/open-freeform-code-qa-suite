The issue is likely due to Gradle using a different version of Java than the one you specified for your project. You need to ensure that Gradle uses the same Java version.

You can specify the Java version for Gradle in the `gradle.properties` file in your project root directory. If the file doesn't exist, create it. Then add the following line:

```properties
org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk17
```

Replace `/path/to/your/jdk17` with the actual path to your JDK 17 installation.

If you're unsure where your JDK 17 is installed, in IntelliJ you can go to `File -> Project Structure -> SDKs` and see the path there.

After you've done this, try to rebuild your project. If the problem persists, you might need to invalidate caches and restart IntelliJ (`File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart... -> Invalidate and Restart`).
