In your code, you are wrapping a JSON result inside an Ok result, which is unnecessary. The `Ok()` method already returns a status code of 200 and formats the response as JSON.

You should return your data directly from the `Ok()` method like this:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return Ok("123");
}
```

This will return a 200 status code with the body containing just the string "123".

If you want to return a more complex object as JSON, you can do it like this:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    var data = new { Id = 123, Name = "John Doe" };
    return Ok(data);
}
```

This will return a 200 status code with the body containing the JSON representation of the `data` object.
