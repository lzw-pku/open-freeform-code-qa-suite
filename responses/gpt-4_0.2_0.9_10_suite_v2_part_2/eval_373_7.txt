The error you're seeing is due to a version mismatch between the Hibernate Validator and the Bean Validation API. The `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` constraints are part of Bean Validation 2.0, which is implemented by Hibernate Validator 6.0 and later. 

However, your logs indicate that Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2 is being used, which only supports Bean Validation 1.1. In this version, `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` constraints are not yet available, hence the error.

The version of Hibernate Validator being used is likely coming from your application server (JBoss). Application servers often provide certain libraries (like Hibernate Validator) out of the box, and these libraries can conflict with the versions you're trying to use in your application.

To resolve this issue, you have a couple of options:

1. **Upgrade your application server**: If you upgrade to a newer version of JBoss (or WildFly, which is the new name for JBoss), it may come with a newer version of Hibernate Validator that supports Bean Validation 2.0.

2. **Override the provided libraries**: You can tell your application server to use the version of Hibernate Validator that your application provides, instead of the one that comes with the server. This is done differently depending on the server, so you'll need to look up how to do it for JBoss.

3. **Downgrade your validation constraints**: If you can't upgrade your server or override the libraries, you can use the older `@NotNull` and `@Size(min=1)` constraints instead of `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank`. This is not ideal because it's less expressive and more error-prone, but it's a workaround if you're stuck with older libraries.
