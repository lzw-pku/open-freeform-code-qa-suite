The error you're encountering is due to a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the version of Maven used in the Spring Boot project (3.8.5). IntelliJ IDEA uses an embedded version of Maven, and sometimes this can cause conflicts with the version specified in your project.

Here are a few potential solutions:

1. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**: Make sure you're using the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA. JetBrains regularly releases updates to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of tools like Maven.

2. **Change the Maven version in IntelliJ IDEA**: You can configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the same version of Maven as your project. Go to `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven`. In the `Maven home directory` field, point to the directory where the same version of Maven as your project is installed.

3. **Downgrade the Maven version in your project**: If the above solutions don't work, consider downgrading the Maven version in your project to a version that's compatible with IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by changing the version in the `pom.xml` file.

Remember to re-import the project after making these changes.
