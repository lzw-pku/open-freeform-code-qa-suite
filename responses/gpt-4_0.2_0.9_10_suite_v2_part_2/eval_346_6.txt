This error is caused by an incompatibility between the version of Maven bundled with IntelliJ IDEA and the version used by your project. IntelliJ IDEA uses an embedded version of Maven, and sometimes this version is not compatible with the one used in your project.

There are a few ways to solve this issue:

1. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**: JetBrains regularly releases updates for IntelliJ IDEA that often include fixes for such issues. Check if there's an update available for your IntelliJ IDEA.

2. **Change the Maven version in IntelliJ IDEA**: You can change the version of Maven used by IntelliJ IDEA to match the one used by your project. To do this, go to `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven`. In the `Maven home directory` field, select the directory where the correct version of Maven is installed.

3. **Downgrade the Maven version in your project**: If you can't change the version of Maven used by IntelliJ IDEA, you can downgrade the version of Maven used in your project to match the one used by IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by changing the version in your `pom.xml` file.

Remember to re-import your project after making these changes.
