The issue you're facing could be due to IntelliJ IDEA 2017 not fully supporting Java 11. 

Java 11 support was added in IntelliJ IDEA 2018.2 and later versions. If you're using a version prior to this, you might encounter problems. 

Here's what you can do:

1. Upgrade your IntelliJ IDEA to a version that supports Java 11 (2018.2 or later).
2. After upgrading, go to `File > Project Structure > Project Settings > Project` and set the `Project SDK` to your installed JDK 11. Also, set the `Project language level` to 11.
3. Go to `File > Project Structure > Project Settings > Modules` and ensure that the `Module SDK` is set to the Project SDK (JDK 11).

Regarding the JDK and JRE folders, since Java 9, the JRE is included in the JDK, so you won't see separate folders for them.

Remember to restart IntelliJ IDEA after making these changes.
