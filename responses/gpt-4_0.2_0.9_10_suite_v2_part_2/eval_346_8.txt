This error is caused by an incompatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the Maven version (3.8.5) that comes with Spring Boot 2.7. IntelliJ IDEA has not yet updated its embedded Maven to support this version.

To resolve this issue, you can downgrade the Maven version in your project to a version that is compatible with IntelliJ IDEA. For example, you can use Maven 3.8.4. 

To do this, you need to modify the `pom.xml` file in your project. Change the `maven-wrapper-plugin` version to `0.5.6` and `maven` version to `3.8.4`:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.takari</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-wrapper-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>0.5.6</version>
    <configuration>
        <distributionUrl>https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/3.8.4/apache-maven-3.8.4-bin.zip</distributionUrl>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

After making these changes, re-import the project in IntelliJ IDEA. The error should be resolved.
