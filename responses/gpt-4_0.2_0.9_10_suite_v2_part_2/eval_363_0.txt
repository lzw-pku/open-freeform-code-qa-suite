The error message you're seeing is due to the fact that Spring Cloud 2020.0.2 (also known as Ilford) has introduced a new way of loading configuration data through the `spring.config.import` property. This is part of the changes in Spring Boot 2.4 and later for loading configuration data.

In your case, since you're not using a Config Server, you can disable the Config Server Config Data Import by adding the following property to your `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

```properties
spring.cloud.config.enabled=false
```

Or, if you're using YAML:

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      enabled: false
```

This will disable the Config Server Config Data Import and should resolve the error you're seeing.

If you want to disable it only for tests, you can add it to the `properties` attribute in the `@SpringBootTest` annotation:

```java
@SpringBootTest(
    webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT,
    classes = {
        ProductCompositeServiceApplication.class,
        TestSecurityConfig.class },
    properties = {
        "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true",
        "spring.cloud.config.enabled=false" })
```

This should resolve the issue you're facing.
