The error message "The selected directory is not a valid home for JDK" usually means that IntelliJ IDEA cannot find the necessary JDK files in the specified directory. 

Since Java 9, Oracle has stopped shipping a separate JRE with JDK, so you won't see a separate JRE folder for JDK 11, which is expected and not an issue.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check your IntelliJ IDEA version**: IntelliJ IDEA 2017.x versions have partial support for Java 9 and later versions. You might need to upgrade your IntelliJ IDEA to a newer version (2018.3 or later) for full support of Java 11.

2. **Check your JDK installation**: Make sure your JDK 11 is installed correctly. You can verify this by running `javac -version` in your command prompt. It should return `javac 11.0.1`.

3. **Add JDK manually in IntelliJ IDEA**: Go to `File > Project Structure > SDKs > Add new SDK > JDK`, then navigate to your JDK 11 installation directory (`C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1`). Make sure you select the JDK directory, not the bin directory inside it.

4. **Check your Project and Module settings**: In `File > Project Structure`, make sure your Project SDK is set to JDK 11. Also, in `Modules > Sources`, make sure the Language Level is set to 11.

5. **Check your Maven or Gradle configuration**: If you're using Maven or Gradle, make sure you've set the correct source and target Java versions in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file.

If none of these steps work, you might want to try reinstalling JDK 11 and IntelliJ IDEA.
