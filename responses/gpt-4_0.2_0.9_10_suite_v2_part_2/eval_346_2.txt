The error you're encountering is due to a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the Maven version (3.8.5) that comes with Spring Boot 2.7. IntelliJ IDEA may not support this version of Maven yet.

Here are a few possible solutions:

1. **Downgrade Maven version**: You can manually downgrade the Maven version in your project to a version that is compatible with your IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by modifying the `pom.xml` file or changing the Maven settings in IntelliJ IDEA.

2. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**: Make sure you are using the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA. JetBrains regularly updates IntelliJ IDEA to support the latest versions of Maven.

3. **Use External Maven**: You can configure IntelliJ IDEA to use an external Maven installation that is compatible. Go to `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven` and set the `Maven home directory` to your external Maven installation.

Remember to re-import the project after making these changes.
