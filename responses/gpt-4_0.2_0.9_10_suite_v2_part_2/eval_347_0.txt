The error you're seeing is likely because Gradle is not using the correct Java version. You can specify the Java version for Gradle in IntelliJ IDEA by following these steps:

1. Go to `File -> Settings` (or `IntelliJ IDEA -> Preferences` for macOS).
2. Navigate to `Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle`.
3. Under `Gradle JVM`, select your `17` version of the JDK.

If the problem persists, you can try to specify the Java version in your `gradle.properties` file:

```properties
org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk17
```

Replace `/path/to/your/jdk17` with the actual path to your JDK 17 installation.

Also, make sure you're using a Gradle version that supports Java 17. As of now, Gradle 7.3 and above support Java 17. You can specify the Gradle version in your `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file:

```properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.3-bin.zip
```

After making these changes, try to rebuild your project.
