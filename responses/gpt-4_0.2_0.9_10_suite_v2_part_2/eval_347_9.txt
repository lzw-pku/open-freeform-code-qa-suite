The issue is likely due to the Gradle version you're using. Gradle versions prior to 7.0 do not support Java 17. 

To resolve this issue, you need to upgrade your Gradle version to 7.0 or later. You can do this by modifying the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file in your project. 

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file, which is usually located in the `gradle/wrapper` directory of your project.
2. Change the `distributionUrl` property to the latest Gradle distribution. As of now, the latest stable version is 7.3.1. So, your `distributionUrl` should look like this:

```properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.3.1-bin.zip
```

3. Save the file and re-import your project in IntelliJ IDEA. 

After doing this, your project should be able to compile and run with Java 17.
