The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Spring Boot, by default, uses Jackson for JSON serialization/deserialization, but does not include a library for XML serialization/deserialization.

To enable XML responses, you need to add a library that can handle XML, such as Jackson Dataformat XML or JAXB.

If you're using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-dataformat-xml</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

If you're using Gradle, add the following dependency to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-xml'
```

After adding this dependency, Spring should be able to automatically configure the necessary beans to support XML responses.
