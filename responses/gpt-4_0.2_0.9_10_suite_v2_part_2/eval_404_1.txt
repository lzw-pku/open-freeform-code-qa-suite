In your code, you are wrapping a JSON result inside an Ok result, which is not necessary. The `Ok()` method already returns a status code of 200 and formats the response in JSON by default.

Here is the correct way to return JSON with a HTTP status code in a .NET Core Web API controller:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return Ok("123");
}
```

This will return a response with a status code of 200 and a body of "123". If you want to return a JSON object, you can do it like this:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return Ok(new { value = "123" });
}
```

This will return a response with a status code of 200 and a body of `{"value":"123"}`.

If you want to return a different status code, you can use different methods like `BadRequest()`, `NotFound()`, etc., or you can use the `StatusCode()` method and specify the status code you want. For example:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return StatusCode(201, new { value = "123" });
}
```

This will return a response with a status code of 201 and a body of `{"value":"123"}`.
