The error message you're seeing is because Hibernate Validator 5.3.x does not support `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` for `String` types. These constraints are supported starting from Hibernate Validator 6.0.x.

The problem is that you're using Spring Boot 2.0.4.RELEASE which, by default, uses Hibernate Validator 5.3.x. 

To solve this issue, you have two options:

1. Upgrade your Spring Boot version to 2.3.x or later, which uses Hibernate Validator 6.1.x by default. This version supports `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` for `String` types.

2. If you can't upgrade Spring Boot, you can override the Hibernate Validator version in your `pom.xml` to use 6.0.x or later. However, this might cause other issues if there are incompatibilities between Spring Boot 2.0.4.RELEASE and Hibernate Validator 6.0.x.

Here's how you can override the Hibernate Validator version:

```xml
<properties>
    <hibernate-validator.version>6.0.11.Final</hibernate-validator.version>
</properties>
```

Add this in your `pom.xml` file, just below the `java.version` property. This will tell Maven to use Hibernate Validator 6.0.11.Final instead of the version that comes with Spring Boot 2.0.4.RELEASE.

Remember to clean and rebuild your project after making these changes.
