The `Ok()` method of the controller automatically converts the object you pass into JSON. So, you don't need to use `Json()` method inside `Ok()`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return Ok("123");
}
```

This will return a HTTP 200 status code with the body containing just the string "123".

If you want to return a different HTTP status code, you can use the `StatusCode()` method, like this:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return StatusCode(201, "123");
}
```

This will return a HTTP 201 status code with the body containing just the string "123".

If you want to return a complex object as JSON, you can do it like this:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    var data = new { Name = "John", Age = 30 };
    return Ok(data);
}
```

This will return a HTTP 200 status code with the body containing the JSON representation of the `data` object.
