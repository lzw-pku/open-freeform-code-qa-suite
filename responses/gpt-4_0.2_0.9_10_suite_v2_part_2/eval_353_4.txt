The error message you're seeing suggests that the `--add-opens` option is not recognized. This option is a JVM argument introduced in Java 9 to relax the strong encapsulation of Java Platform Module System. 

However, your Java version is 1.8, which does not support this option, hence the error. 

Hyperledger Besu requires Java 11 or later to run. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or install it using a package manager like `apt` for Ubuntu or `brew` for MacOS.

After installing Java 11 or later, you can verify the installation by running the following command:

```shell
java -version
```

The output should indicate that you're running Java 11 or later. After that, you should be able to run Hyperledger Besu without encountering the `--add-opens` error.
