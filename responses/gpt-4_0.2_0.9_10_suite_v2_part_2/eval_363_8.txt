The error message you're seeing is because Spring Cloud 2020.0.2 (part of Spring Boot 2.4.2) introduces a new way of loading configuration data through the `spring.config.import` property. This is part of the new Config Data API and it's mandatory to set this property if you're using Spring Cloud Config.

However, you mentioned that your project is not a ConfigServer and doesn't use ConfigServer. The problem is that you have the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency in your `build.gradle` file, which is used for connecting to a ConfigServer.

```groovy
implementation('org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-config')
```

If you're not using ConfigServer, you can remove this dependency from your `build.gradle` file and the error should go away.

If you're using ConfigServer in some environments but not in others (like in your tests), you can disable the ConfigServer bootstrap configuration in your tests by adding the following property to your `@SpringBootTest` annotation:

```java
@SpringBootTest(
    webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT,
    classes = {
        ProductCompositeServiceApplication.class,
        TestSecurityConfig.class },
    properties = {
        "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true",
        "spring.cloud.config.enabled=false" })
```

This will disable the ConfigServer bootstrap configuration and the error should go away.
