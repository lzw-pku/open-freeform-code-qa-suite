The issue you're facing might be due to the IntelliJ IDEA version you're using. IntelliJ IDEA 2017 does not fully support Java 11. 

Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Upgrade your IntelliJ IDEA to the latest version (2021.2.3 as of October 2021). You can download it from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

2. After upgrading, open your project and go to `File > Project Structure > Project`.

3. In the `Project SDK` section, select the JDK 11 that you installed. If it's not listed, click on `New > JDK` and navigate to the location where JDK 11 is installed (`C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1`).

4. Set the `Project language level` to `11 - Local variable syntax for lambda parameters`.

5. Click `OK` to save the changes.

6. Go to `Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler` and ensure that the `Target bytecode version` for all your modules is set to 11.

7. Rebuild your project.

This should resolve the issue. If you still face problems, please let me know.
