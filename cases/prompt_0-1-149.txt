How to make an animation after hovering over the link by using Tailwind-CSS. I have tried using `:after`, but it didn't work out.

This is my code:
```html
<a href="#" class="group text-sky-600 transition duration-300">
    Link
    <span class="block max-w-0 duration-500 h-0.5 bg-sky-600"></span>
</a>
```

Could you help me to revise the above code to realize this? I prefer doing so with pure tailwind, without writing css.
