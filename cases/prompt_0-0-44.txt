How do I create an index of property in mongoose schema using Nest.js?

I tried to add index as a property option, But the index hasn't been created:

```javascript
@Schema()
export class Schema extends Document {

  @Prop()
  _id: string;

  @Prop({required: true, index: true})
  type: string;

  @Prop()
  creationDate: string;

  @Prop()
  name: string;
}

export const MySchema = SchemaFactory.createForClass(Schema);
```

I tried this way too:

```javascript
export const MySchema = SchemaFactory.createForClass(Schema).index({ type: 1 });
```

Both doesn't work as expected.

What is the way to do that?
