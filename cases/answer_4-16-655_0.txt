These expansions are done by GitLab CI, not by bash, so they probably simply can't handle nested expansions as robustly as bash can.

They probably think the variable name is everything up to the next }, so CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME:-${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH:-$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH without a closing curly brace. That would explain why there is a leftover } when the dust settles.
