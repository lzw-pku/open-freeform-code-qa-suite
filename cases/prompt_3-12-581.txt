Flutter: RenderBox was not laid out

I'm trying to create a ListView but when I import the list_form.dart class i get this error. Maybe I made some mistakes with the layout because if I try to run it inside the main file I don't get this error.

This is the error:

```

Don't worry if there is some unused code, it's a work in progress and this error just stopped me continuing what I was doing.
