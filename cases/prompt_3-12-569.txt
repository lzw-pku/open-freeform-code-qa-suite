Flutter ChangeNotifierProvider builder is deprecated

I have this code in my main.dart:

```
main() {
  runApp(
    MultiProvider(
      providers: [
        ChangeNotifierProvider(builder: (context) => Auth()), // /**problem here. builder displayed with strikethrough line**/
      ],
      child: App(),
    ),
  );
}
```


since about 2 days ago, my visual studio code showing this warning:

so I guess builder parameter on ChangeNotifierProvider is deprecated. I searched everywhere but can't find alternative to this builder parameter. So how to remove these warning? Below is my flutter version using `flutter --version` command on Windows 10

```
> flutter --version
Flutter 1.9.1+hotfix.6 • channel stable • https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
Framework • revision 68587a0916 (3 months ago) • 2019-09-13 19:46:58 -0700
Engine • revision b863200c37
Tools • Dart 2.5.0
```


For any help, thanks in advance
