I am trying to replace our current backend service using Nestjs library, however, I want to create a route with 2 optional parameters in the URL something like:

`/route/:param1/config/:OptionalParam3?/:OptionalParam3?`

that means the route should catch:

- `route/aa/config`
- `route/aa/config/bb`
- `route/aa/config/bb/cc`


Could you help me to revise the above route pattern to fulfill the requirement? You should only output the generated pattern string and enclose the generated pattern with "```".
