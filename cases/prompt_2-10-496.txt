How to sort a Vec of structs by 2 or multiple fields?
Example:
```rust
struct MyStruct{
    row: u8,
    column: u8
}

let my_vector = a Vec<MyStruct> with like 100 items in it
```
I want to sort `my_vector` list of say 100 items by row and then by column so I get my vector looking like `sample 1`:
sample 1
```rust
my_vector = vec![
MyStruct { row: 10, column: 1 },
MyStruct { row: 10, column: 2 },
MyStruct { row: 10, column: 3 }, ]
```
I want both my rows and columns to be ordered. How can I do this?
