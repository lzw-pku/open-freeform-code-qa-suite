Is there any way to change background color dynamically on scroll?

Could you please fill in [blank] in the following code to complete this task?  Specifically, please don't add other text and repeat the following code with [blank] filled.

```javascript
const [red, green, blue] = [69, 111, 225]
const section1 = document.querySelector('.section1')

window.addEventListener([blank], () => {
  let y = 1 + (window.scrollY || window.pageYOffset) / 150
  y = y < 1 ? 1 : y // ensure y is always >= 1 (due to Safari's elastic scroll)
  const [r, g, b] = [red/y, green/y, blue/y].map(Math.round)
  section1.[blank] = `rgb(${r}, ${g}, ${b})`
})
```
