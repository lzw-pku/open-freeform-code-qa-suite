Command CompileSwift failed with a nonzero exit code in Xcode 10

After updating to the latest version of Xcode at the moment (version 10.0) the project is unable to build because it found some errors regarding some "Command CompileSwift failed with a nonzero exit code" error.

They appear in most of the Pods (I use CocoaPods) I use inside my project.
I have tried updating the pod version and the pods to the latest version available, but the problem is still there.
I have searched a lot through the web and there is very little information regarding this issue.
