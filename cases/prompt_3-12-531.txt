Here is a snippet written in dart:
```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String s = myMap[1];
  }
}
```
This snippet give me the warning:
```
A value of type 'String?' can't be assigned to a variable of type 'String'. Try changing the type of the variable, or casting the right-hand type to 'String'.
```
How to solve the warning?
