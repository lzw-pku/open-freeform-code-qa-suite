macOS Catalina 10.15(beta) - Why is ~/.bash_profile not sourced by my shell?

I want to set the environment variable I added below the line to `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.profile` but it didn't work.

```
export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7
```


Afterward, exit the terminal and open it again when executing `echo $JBOSS_HOME` I get nothing.
