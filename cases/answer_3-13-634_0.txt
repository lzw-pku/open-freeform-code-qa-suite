For my users, waiting nearly a month till December 10 for a fix release from Microsoft is not an option. Nor is uninstalling the offending Microsoft update across several government locked down workstations.

I need to apply a workaround, but am not exactly thrilled with what Microsoft suggested - creating and substituting a query for each table.

The solution is to replace the Table name with a simple (SELECT * FROM Table) query directly in the UPDATE command. This does not require creating and saving a ton of additional queries, tables, or functions.

EXAMPLE:

Before:

UPDATE Table1 SET Field1 = "x" WHERE (Field2=1);
After:

UPDATE (SELECT * FROM Table1) SET Field1 = "x" WHERE (Field2=1);
That should be much easier to implement across several databases and applications (and later rollback).
