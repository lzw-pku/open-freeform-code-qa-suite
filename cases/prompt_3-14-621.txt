SwiftUI @State var initialization issue

I would like to initialise the value of a `@State` var in SwiftUI through the `init()` method of a `Struct`, so it can take the proper text from a prepared dictionary for manipulation purposes in a TextField.
The source code looks like this:
```
swift
struct StateFromOutside: View {
    let list = [
        "a": "Letter A",
        "b": "Letter B",
        // ...
    ]
    @State var fullText: String = ""

    init(letter: String) {
        self.fullText = list[letter]!
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField($fullText)
    }
}
```

Unfortunately the execution fails with the error `Thread 1: Fatal error: Accessing State<String> outside View.body`
How can I resolve the situation? Thank you very much in advance!
