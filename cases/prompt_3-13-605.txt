Module was compiled with an incompatible version of Kotlin. The binary version of its metadata is 1.5.1, expected version is 1.1.15

My client wants email and cardholder name, but the Stripe payment UI doesn't provide that option in `com.stripe.android.view.CardMultilineWidget`. I wanted to give it a try with the latest stripe version,

1. I was using Stripe version (14.1.1). So I updated it to the latest one (16.8.0)
2. The build showed me the error that it doesn't take minSdkVersion 19. It requires 21 in manifest merger. So I updated minSdkVersion to 21.
3. I got caches/transforms-2/files-2.1/4541b0189187e0017d23bbb0afebd16a/jetified-kotlin-stdlib-common-1.5.0.jar!/META-INF/kotlin-stdlib-common.kotlin_module: Module was compiled with an incompatible version of Kotlin. The binary version of its metadata is 1.5.1, expected version is 1.1.15.


I tried changing the Gradle version, but I am still getting the same error. How can I solve the incompatible error and add the email and cardholder name in Stripe?
