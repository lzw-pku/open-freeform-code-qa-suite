I have a NextJS app without an integrated API that I want to deploy to Vercel. It works fine when I run `yarn run dev` locally and I can also build it with command `yarn run build`. However, when I deploy it Vercel, I receive a 404 Error. I don't have a nextjs config file. My assumption is that the error is caused by the dynamic route but I can't find my mistake. Also, no page is working when the app is deployed as opposed to only the dynamic page. I am using NextJs 10.0.3. Could you tell me how to fix it?
