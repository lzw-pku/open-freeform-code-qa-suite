I am using a react hook component with antd. When setting up columns for a table, the render function is giving me an ESLint error:

```
ESLint: Component definition is missing displayName (react/display-name)
```

I have tried adding displayName to the object but this doesn't work.

This is the code:

```jsx
const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: text => (
        <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>
      ),
    }
  ]
```

Do you know how to shut down the ESLint's error by editing the above code snippet?
