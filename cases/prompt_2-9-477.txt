Ruby: BUILD FAILED (macOS 11.2 using ruby-build 20210119) Mac Big Sur

I looked at this [Ruby installation (2.2.2) fails in macOS Big Sur](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65524323/ruby-installation-2-2-2-fails-in-macos-big-sur)
My macOS is Big Sur and the version I have is 11.2 and it was the closest I could find to the issue I'm having with my OS, I followed what I could by trying
```
CFLAGS="-Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration" rbenv install 2.5.3
```

and also
```
RUBY_CFLAGS=-DUSE_FFI_CLOSURE_ALLOC rbenv install 2.5.3
```

This is the output in my Terminal:

I get this error for both commands mentioned above and both give this same output.
The version of Ruby also doesn't seem to matter, I've tried 3.0.0 as well and get the same results.
Additionally this is the original output when I try to just install ruby with `rbenv install`

xcode-select version is 2384.
Homebrew version is 3.0.0 and `brew doctor` say's I'm ready to brew.
My .zshrc file also contains this line `eval "$(rbenv init -)"`
At this point I'm not sure where else to turn 
If there is any specifics you want to see in the log file let me know where from, the log file is too big to share here. Why is this happening and how can I fix this? ‍♂️
