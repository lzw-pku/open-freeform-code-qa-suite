Android Studio Emulator Tool Windows Not Show

I was creating a flutter project, but I want to run my AVD in the android studio window itself, I already select the option in "Settings-> Tools-> Emulator" and check the option that says "Launch in a tool windows" but it still executes me regardless of the emulator.

I've already done several unsuccessful searches, does anyone have any ideas?

Create a project in normal java and there if that window appears I think it is a problem in flutter or something similar.
