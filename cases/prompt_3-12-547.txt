How to make super constructor required in dart

I would like the IDE to inform me that I need to construct super constructor in inherited widget's constructor. Say for example if I have abstract class like below
```
abstract class BaseClass {
  final String name;

  BaseClass({
    @required String name,
  }) : this.name = name;
}
```

I want the child class to know that I need to implement the super constructor. The below code throws at runtime but how do I make sure that it throws in build time or IDE lets me know before build?
```
class ChildClass extends BaseClass{}
```
