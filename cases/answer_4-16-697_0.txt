Each command runs a separate sub-shell, so the environment variables are not preserved and .bashrc is not sourced.

You have to source your script manually in the same process where you run your command so it would be:

CMD source /root/.bashrc && /workspace/launch.sh
provided your launch.sh is an executable.
