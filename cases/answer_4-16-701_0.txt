Going off this question, you don't need a function for this but can retrieve this with $Env:Path:

$Env:Path -split ";" -contains $directory
The -contains operator is case-insensitive which is a bonus. It could be useful placing this in a function to ensure trailing slashes are trimmed, but that's uncommon:

function inPath($directory) {
    return ($Env:Path -split ';').TrimEnd('\') -contains $directory.TrimEnd('\')
}
