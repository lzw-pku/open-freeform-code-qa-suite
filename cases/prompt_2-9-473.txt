I've finished 11 chapters of the rails tutorial, deployed my app to heroku (locally it worked perfectly) and it crashing all time. I'm using rails 5.2.2 After execution of command $heroku run rails console I'm receiving this:
```
/app/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.5.0/gems/activesupport-5.2.2/lib/active_support/message_encryptor.rb:206:in `rescue in _decrypt': ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor::InvalidMessage (ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor::InvalidMessage)
```
And I'm receiving these errors when deploying to heroku:
```
To heroku.com:cryptic-chamber-73265.git
 ! [remote rejected] master -> master (pre-receive hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@heroku.com:cryptic-chamber-73265.git'
```
How to fix the error?
Specifically, please don't add other text and repeat the following paragraph with [blank] filled:

1. Remove the [blank]:
```
rm -rf config/[blank]
```
2. Create a new [blank]:
```
EDITOR=\"mate --wait\" bin/rails credentials:edit
```
