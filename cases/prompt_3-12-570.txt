Flutter Pub: Expected a key while parsing a block mapping. path:

I'm using JSON file and register in `Pubspec.ymal` but showing error and also when I use an image and register it, the same error also occurs. Maybe there is a formatting mistake in it, but don't know what the problem is.this is the [doc](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/pubspec) I followed.

This is my `pubspec.yaml` file

```
