I got borders on all the edges by doing something like:

```html
<div class="border border-blue-900">foo</div>
```

It is actually a mistake, since I want to draw a line only to the TOP. I tried the following code, but the lines are drawn on all edges.

```html
<div class="border border-blue-900 border-t-1">foo</div>
```

How to have the line drawn only to the top?
