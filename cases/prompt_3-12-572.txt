Flutter - How to show text and icon in one line in row?

I am using row widget with three child widgets:
Text
Icon
Text

I want all of them to appear in single line same level horizontally  and drop to new line if text increases.

I am using below code for Row widget but last Text widget is not aligned correctly

The text dropping should start below the "`Tap`" and "`on the right hand`" is not aligned

```
Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.start,
  mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
  children: <Widget>[
    Text(
      'Tap ',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 17,
      ),
    ),
    Icon(Icons.add),
    Expanded(
      child: Text(
        'on the right hand corner to start a new chat.',
        style: TextStyle(
          fontSize: 17,
        ),
      ),
    )
  ],
)
```
