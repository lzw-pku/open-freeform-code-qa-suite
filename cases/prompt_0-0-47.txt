I am writing typescript. I would like to specify a function that takes an array of objects as a parameter, but I don't have a particular type defined for the object (a sort of "anonymous type"):

```typescript
bagTotal = (products) => {
 // function does stuff
}
```

Actually, I would like to impose a strict type for `products` like this:
```typescript
bagTotal = (products: [{name: string, price: number, description: string}]) => {
 // function does stuff
}
```

But this is not right. Could you fix the definition for me?
