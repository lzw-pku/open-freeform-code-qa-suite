How to add a new pair to Map in Dart? Code:
```dart
Map<String, int> someMap = {
  "a": 1,
  "b": 2,
};

someMap["c"] = 3;
```
I caught the following errors:
- Variables must be declared using the keywords const, final, var, or a type name
- Expected to find;
- the name someMap is already defined
Specifically, pelase don't add other text and repeat the following paragraph with [blank] filled:

The reason it didn't work is that this needs to be done inside a [blank], not at the top level.
Another solution is to declare your map in Flutter with the keyword \"[blank]\".
