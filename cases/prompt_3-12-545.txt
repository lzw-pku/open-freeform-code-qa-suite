When I execute the following dart code I am unable to recieve data and the error thrown is:
Bad state: Cannot set the body fields of a Request with content-type "application/json".
The code is:
```dart
Map<String,String> headers = {'Content-Type':'application/json','authorization':'Basic c3R1ZHlkb3RlOnN0dWR5ZG90ZTEyMw=='};

var response = await post(Urls.getToken,
        headers: headers,
        body: {"grant_type":"password","username":"******","password":"*****","scope":"offline_access"},
      );
```
How to fix it?
