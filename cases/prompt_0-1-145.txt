I am using truncate in TailwindCSS to make text ellipsis if text-overflow more than one line but it does not work.

My code not works below:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold truncate">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

How can I fix It?
