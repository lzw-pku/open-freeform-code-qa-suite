Why doesn't nested parameter expansion work correctly in GitLab CI/CD?

Using a `bash` runner, is there any reason why the following variable expansion shouldn't work?
```
variables:
  GIT_BRANCH: "${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME:-${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH:-$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH}}"

job1:
  script:
    - echo $GIT_BRANCH
```

The job outputs `}`.
I'm using GitLab Enterprise Edition 14.1.8-ee.
