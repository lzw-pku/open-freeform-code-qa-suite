In C++, please complete the two following functions:

1. Have a function named ```my_2d_array(int N, int M)``` which takes two arguments M and N and returns a matrix or 2d-array of dimension (M*N) with elements indicating the position of that element. E.g. calling my_2d_array(4,3) would return:
[[00, 01, 02],
[10, 11, 12],
[20, 21, 22],
[30, 31, 32]]

2. The main function should execute my_2d_array and be able to potentially perform calculations with the result or modify it. In the main function, print the return value (which is the M*N matrix) of my_2d_array, and elements are separate with ' '. After each line is output, a '\n' character is output.
