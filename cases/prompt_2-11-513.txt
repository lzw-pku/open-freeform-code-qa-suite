How to properly solve memset() function MISRA errors in C?

I have written a simple function to initialise the structure values using `memset()`. These are the code I have written in C language.

```
typedef struct{
 bool flag;
 bool check;
 int val_1;
 int val_2;
} MY_STRUCT;
```


```
static MY_STRUCT mystruct;

void Test()
{
  memset(&mystruct, 0, sizeof(MY_STRUCT)); 
}
```

When i run MISRA , i am getting this kind of error
```
The return value of non-void function 'memset' shall be used
```

I have tried to fix this warning using below method
```
(void)memset(&mystruct, 0, sizeof(MY_STRUCT));
```

But unfortunately, i am getting 2 new warnings
```
Cast between types that are not both pointers or not pointers

object of pointer type 'void*' cast to unrelated type 'void'
```

Anybody suggest how to fix this warning while using `memset()` function ? Also please explain to avoid such warnings in future.
