In React.js, what is the proper way to chain queries if the second query requires a parameter that is returned by the first query?

Concretely, I have the first query

```javascript
const { data: user } = useGetUserQuery();
```

and the `user` object contains `id` that is used to run the second query

```javascript
const { data: userBio } = useGetUserBioQuery(user.id);
```

How do I make sure the second query runs only after the first one is fulfilled?

Specifically, I have change the first query to be

```javascript
const { data: user, isFulfilled: userFulfilled } = useGetUserQuery();
```

Please output the second query code for me. You don't need to add other explanation text or repeat my context code.
