I created a simple flutter app and run it on android emulator. It worked Ok. Now I created another one and when I'm trying to run it on the emulator I'm getting:
```
Error: ADB exited with exit code 1
adb: failed to install /Users/Admin/Development/flutter/flutter_app_test/build/app/outputs/apk/app.apk: Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE]
Error launching application on Android SDK built for x86.
```
So anytime I have one flutter app installed on the emulator installing another one will lead to the same error.
Is there a way to overcome this limitation?
Specifically, pelase don't add other text and repeat the following paragraph with [blank] filled:

You probably configures [blank] too small and you get this error when the emulator runs out of [blank] when you install.
Open the [blank] manager in Android Studio, edit the emulator and increase \"[blank]\" and restart the emulator.
