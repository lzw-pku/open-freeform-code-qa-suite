PowerShell I want to cut off a string after a specific character sequence

I am trying to parse a string variable where everything after -354 gets cut off.
I have variables that look like this: NameOfFile-354-XX.pdf
Where NameOfFile can be any length and -XX can be anything or not even there at all.
I want the print of this variable to be: NameOfFile-354
How do I cut the variable so it cuts after -354?
What I have tried so far:
```
$FileArray = @("Name1-354-03.pdf", "Name23-354-H11.pdf", "Name354-354-02.pdf", "Name3545-354.pdf")
ForEach ($n in $FileArray){
     Write-Host $n.Substring(0, $n.lastIndexOf('-354'))
}
```

I want the output to be this:
```
Name1-354
Name23-354
Name354-354
Name3545-354
```

Thank you for your help.
