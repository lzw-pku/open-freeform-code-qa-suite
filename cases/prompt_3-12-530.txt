Convert nullable variable with int.parse using dart

Do I need to convert a string? to an int if the value in the string is not null. (My routeArgs variable may be is null) I was doing according to this code before the null safety:
```
final routeArgs = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as Map<String, String>;
if(routeArgs["id"] != null){
   id = int.parse(routeArgs["id"]);
 }
```

But now it displays the error stating: "The argument type 'String?' can't be assigned to the parameter type 'String'."  I tried to correct as the code below:
```
final routeArgs = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as Map<String, String>;
   
    int id;
    String? idtest = routeArgs["id"]; 
    if (idtest != null){
      id = int.parse(idtest);
    }
```

This code stopped giving error, but I think this is not the correct way to solve it, I would need to do this for several variable values. Would it be correct for me to make a function just for conversion? Could anyone give me an idea of a solution?
