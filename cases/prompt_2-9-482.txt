When upgrading to ruby 3.1, I am seeing the following sort error message when using YAML.load_file some_file_name. Other load statements cause similar errors but cite different unspecified classes e.g. OpenStruct. I have tried:
```
hsh = YAML.load_file some_file_name, permitted_classes: [Matrix, OpenStruct]
```
but this gives the error
```
Psych::DisallowedClass:
   Tried to load unspecified class: Symbol
```
How do I fix this?
Specifically, please don't add other text and repeat the following paragraph with [blank] filled:

You need to add Symbol to the [blank] in your case too when reading the YAML file.
Or when using in Ruby on Rails, you can configure globally in your [blank].
```
config.active_record.[blank] += [Matrix, OpenStruct, Symbol]
```
