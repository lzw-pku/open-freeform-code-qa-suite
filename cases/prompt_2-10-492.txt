I am creating a dapp where multiple users can deposit SOL into an event account, and depending on whoever wins the event, they can redeem SOL back to their wallet.
How can I transfer native SOL (not any other spl-token) directly into the event account's vault address in an anchor smart contract instruction?
Specifically, please don't add other text and repeat the following code solution with [blank] filled:
```
    let ix = anchor_lang::solana_program::system_instruction::transfer(
        &[blank],
        &[blank],
        amount,
    );
    anchor_lang::solana_program::program::invoke(
        &ix,
        &[
            [blank],
            [blank],
        ],
    );
```
