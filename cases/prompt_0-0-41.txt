I am using Angular to get geolocation. If the locaton is available, I would like to `console.log("Location accessed")`; otherwise `console.log("User not allowed")`. I tried the following code but it doesn't work.

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(position => {
        console.log("Location accessed");
    });
} else {
    console.log("User not allowed")
}
```

Could you help me to revise the above code to make it work? You don't need to add other contextual code.
