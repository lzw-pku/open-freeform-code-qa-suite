"if" statement syntax differences between C and C++

```
if (1) int a = 2;
```

This line of code is valid C++ code (it compiles at the very least) yet invalid C code (doesn't compile). I know there are differences between the languages but this one was unexpected.
I always thought the grammar was
```
if (expr) statement
```

but this would make it valid in both.
My questions are:

1. Why doesn't this compile in C?
2. Why does this difference exist?
