How can I tell if a specified folder is in my PATH using PowerShell?

How can I tell if a specified folder is in my PATH using PowerShell?
A function like this would be great:
```
bash
function FolderIsInPATH($Path_to_directory) {
    # If the directory is in PATH, return true, otherwise false
}
```
