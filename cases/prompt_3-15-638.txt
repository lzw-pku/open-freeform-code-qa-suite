SolidWorks API SelectByID2 method

There is a more efficient method using the  and  methods to obtain the points that can be used with SelectByID2 method. The issue of the method below is that creation of each point is not time efficient nor tidy in the feature tree. Will update this thread once I have time.
Thank you for understanding.

I recently started some programming in VBA in SolidWorks and I am looking to write a macro. The goal for now is to create a reference plane from selected face and point(deriving it from edge). As a reminder, method to create the reference plane is InsertRefPlane, which requires the selection to be done by SelectByID2 method.
So far I've managed to save the handle for the face and point objects, but I haven't managed to successfully use the SelectByID2 method. Objects that were selected become deselected.
`value = instance.SelectByID2(Name, Type, X, Y, Z, Append, Mark, Callout, SelectOption)`
I have tried select just a face, but I couldn't manage to do it. Also, I have renamed the face property using the SetEntityName method, and supplied it as well, but it did not manage to select it.
Could you please share the ideas how to do create a reference plane? It doesn't have to be necessary a face and an edge/mid-point.
Thank you in advance.

For further clarification, I have added two objects (face and edge) to selection and I would like to use those to properly select objects with SelectByID2 to use for InsertRefPlane. I have added the code below.
Ideas that I have are:
- I have handles to the face and the edge, but can I use those for proper selection with SelectByID2?- Can I create a reference points on the selected face and edge to identify the face somehow?- SelectByRay seems feasible, but it would require some calculations with face normals so, I would try some other "simpler" methods if available. : I have non-planar face so I can't request Normal property of the face.- : It seems that it all comes down to identifying an object name and type is the way to solve the problem. This is probably a solution, but I'm open for another one, easier if possible. We can create a reference points when using one of appropriate Selection methods, because their names are known, we can use those for SelectbyID2 method.  Will post the solution once I am done.- Regarding the GetFaces/GetFirstFace/GetNextFace methods, [InsertRefPlane](https://help.solidworks.com/2017/english/api/sldworksapi/solidworks.interop.sldworks%7Esolidworks.interop.sldworks.ifeaturemanager%7Einsertrefplane.html) requires objects to be selected by SelectByID2
