Flutter setState to another class?

I have a root class `RootPage` which is a `StatefulWidget` which is always in view. I would like to change the `body` in `RootPage` which is controlled by `RootPage's currentPage Widget` from different classes such as my `FeedPage` class and any other class that I make?

Example code

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class RootPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RootPageState createState() => new _RootPageState();
}
class _RootPageState extends State<RootPage> {
  FeedPage feedPage;

  Widget currentPage;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    feedPage = FeedPage();

    currentPage = feedPage;
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
      //Current page to be changed from other classes too?
      body: currentPage
    );
  }
}



class FeedPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _feedPageState createState() => new _feedPageState();
}
class _feedPageState extends State<FeedPage> {

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new FlatButton(
      onPressed: () {
        setState(() {
          //change the currentPage in RootPage so it switches FeedPage away and gets a new class that I'll make
        });
      },
      child: new Text('Go to a new page but keep root, just replace this feed part'),
    );
  }
}
```


I'm sure there's an obvious answer but I can't seem to figure out how to do it efficiently so it'll be easy to integrate future classes and keep my Root always in view.
