I'm very new to flutter so I couldn't figure it out.
I need a custom AppBar with drawer and actions but arranged like the image.

I tried a StackView in the title widget

```
appBar: AppBar(
    title: Stack(
      children: <Widget>[
        Container(
          width: double.infinity,
          color: CustomColors.accentColor,
        ),
        Text(
          'Title',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 22.0, color: CustomColors.primaryDark),
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ),
```


But I get something like this
