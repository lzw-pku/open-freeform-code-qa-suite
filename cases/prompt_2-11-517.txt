What is the simplest syntax for string interpolation in c++?
I'm used to easy-to-read syntax for string interpolation like this in c# or JavaScript.
In c# strings are interpolated like this:
```c#
$"My variable has value {myVariable}"
```
In JavaScript it looks like this:
```javascript
`My variable has value ${myVariable}`
```
What is the simplest way of doing this in c++?
