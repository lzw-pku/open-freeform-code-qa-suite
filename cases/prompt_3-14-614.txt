Xcode 11 beta swift ui preview not showing

Just playing with Swift UI basic app and the preview canvas is not showing even though I'm in canvas mode. App runs, and I have this little snippet what am I missing?

```
swift
#if DEBUG
struct ContentView_Previews : PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
       ContentView()
    }
}
#endif
```
