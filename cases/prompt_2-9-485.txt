How to enable TLS for Redis 6 on Sidekiq?


## Problem


On my Ruby on Rails app, I keep getting the error below for the [Heroku Redis](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-redis) Premium 0 add-on:
> OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=error: certificate verify failed (self signed certificate in certificate chain)
Heroku Redis [documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-redis#create-a-new-instance) mentions that I need to enable TLS in my Redis client's configuration in order to connect to a Redis 6 database. To achive this, I have read SSL/TLS Support documentation on [redis-rb](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb#ssltls-support). My understanding from it is; I need to assign `ca_file`, `cert` and `key` for `Redis.new#ssl_params`.  how to set these for Redis or through Sidekiq on Heroku?

## Updates


Update 3: Heroku support provided an answer which solved the problem.
Update 2: Created Heroku support ticket and waiting response.
Update 1: [Asked](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4786) on Sidekiq's Github issues and was adviced go write Heroku support. Will update this question, when I do get an answer.
